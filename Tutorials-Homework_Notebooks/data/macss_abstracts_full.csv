macss_01,News to Numbers: A Comparative Analysis of Traditional and API-driven LLMs in Stock Return Prediction,"This thesis investigates the comparative effectiveness of two large language model (LLM) deployment paradigms—zero-shot inference via commercial APIs and supervised fine-tuning of transformer-based models—for stock return prediction using financial news. Leveraging a novel dataset of over 30,000 Dow Jones Newswire (DJN) articles aligned with firm-level returns from 1989 to 2020, the study systematically evaluates OpenAI’s GPT-4 in a zero-shot setting against fine-tuned BERT-based models trained on identical text–return pairs. The analysis employs a rolling-window cross-validation framework to ensure robustness across market regimes and emphasizes not only predictive accuracy but also operational feasibility, cost efficiency, and scalability. Results demonstrate that both modeling approaches produce statistically significant predictive power above random baselines, yet with distinct trade-offs. GPT-4 achieves 53.38% directional accuracy and a Sharpe ratio of 1.076, highlighting its ability to extract meaningful signals without domain-specific tuning. Its operational simplicity, low setup cost, and per-call flexibility make it particularly attractive for rapid deployment and lightweight financial applications. By contrast, the supervised BERT model delivers markedly stronger financial performance, attaining an annualized Sharpe ratio of 4.08 and mean daily returns of 12.81 basis points. These superior outcomes underscore the value of domain-specific adaptation, but they come at the cost of substantial GPU resources, specialized expertise, and ongoing maintenance requirements. Temporal analysis further reveals that both approaches maintain predictive robustness across diverse economic conditions—including the dot-com era, the 2008 financial crisis, and post-crisis market environments—though performance metrics vary with shifts in efficiency and volatility. Importantly, GPT-4 provides consistent positive alphas despite its modest accuracy, while fine-tuned BERT models extract higher-magnitude signals during volatile periods, reinforcing the economic relevance of tailored architectures. The findings contribute to the growing literature at the intersection of financial economics and natural language processing by offering the first unified empirical framework to compare API-driven and locally fine-tuned LLMs for financial prediction. They highlight a fundamental trade-off in institutional strategy: API-based models democratize access to advanced language capabilities with minimal infrastructure, while fine-tuned models yield superior risk-adjusted returns for institutions capable of sustaining the computational investment. This research advances both theory and practice by demonstrating that textual data continues to contain exploitable information for asset pricing and that the operational context—budget, infrastructure, and regulatory considerations—should guide the choice of modeling paradigm. Ultimately, the results suggest that financial institutions must navigate between accessibility and performance, as the integration of LLMs into quantitative trading evolves from experimental adoption toward strategic deployment.",2025,"Bai, Rong"
macss_02,Labor Market Shocks and Heterogeneous Adjustment: A Semi-Nonparametric Approach,"This study examines how labor markets adjust to international trade shocks in recent decades, with a particular focus on the China trade shock that has fundamentally reshaped global manufacturing since the 1990s. To estimate the effect, the project will combine structural economic modeling with semi-parametric machine learning techniques to understand heterogeneous labor market responses across demographic groups and industries. By merging rigorous economic theory with flexible estimation methods, we aim to provide nuanced insights into the transition costs workers face when responding to trade disruption, addressing a gap in the current literature that often treats adjustment frictions as homogeneous across populations. After the estimation, we'll apply agent-based modelling framework on simulated counterfactual sample to experiment with different tariff intervention and agent features to further understand the dynamics and welfare implication.",2025,"Xu, Jingzhi"
macss_03,The Cost of Decentralization? Welfare Comparisons between Double Auctions and Automated Market Makers in Transactive Energy Markets,"This paper quantifies the welfare implications of adopting an Automated Market Maker (AMM) in place of the simultaneous time-delimited double auction used in the Transactive Energy Service System (TESS). We develop an agent-based simulation of a peer-to-peer electricity market populated by heterogeneous demand, solar, utility, and battery agents, and evaluate market outcomes under varying technical and operational parameters. Battery strategies are modeled both through value function iteration (VFI) dynamic programming and an alternative informed trader heuristic that exploits anticipated intertemporal price differentials. Regression analysis on simulation output reveals that, across a broad range of scenarios, the AMM delivers statistically significant gains in total social welfare relative to the double auction. While the VFI battery strategy often generates negative surplus under the AMM, these losses are offset by gains to other agents. The informed trader battery eliminates the negative battery surplus without diminishing total welfare, indicating that strategic adaptation can improve equity of surplus distribution while maintaining efficiency. These results suggest that the cost of decentralization—defined as welfare loss from substituting an AMM for a double auction—can be negative in certain contexts, implying a potential net benefit. However, we find that part of the AMM’s advantage stems from its implicit capacity flexibility, which may not be feasible in practical deployment. We conclude by outlining future research to assess AMM performance under realistic capacity constraints and more diverse trading behaviors.",2025,"Bhatt, Nalin"
macss_04,The Art of Positivity in Drawing: Unveiling the Impact of Positive Mood States on Visual Creativity via Deep Learning,"This study integrates visual creative tasks with artificial intelligence techniques to study the flexibility pathway proposed by the dual pathway to creativity model. According to this model, positive activating moods enhance originality—the uncommonness of ideas, solutions, or products— by increasing cognitive flexibility, which facilitates the switching between thoughts and supports the exploration and connection of diverse ideas. Diverging from the predominance of verbal tasks, this study employs the Incomplete Shape Drawing task to track both the dynamics of the creative process indicative of cognitive flexibility and the originality of the final completed drawings. Using validated film clips for mood induction, I randomly assigned 90 participants to one of three groups: High-Arousal Positive Mood, Low-Arousal Positive Mood, and Neutral Control. Participants then completed three rounds of the Incomplete Shape Drawing Task (with qualitatively distinct stimuli), each followed by a section to provide a written narrative on their thought process. Flexibility was assessed through two modalities: (1) stroke-level drawing behavior using the Compositional Stroke Embedding model to compute entropy and Bhattacharyya distance; and (2) semantic-level flexibility using Divergent Semantic Integration to quantify the integration of conceptually distant ideas in participants’ narratives. Originality was evaluated using AuDrA, a deep learning model trained on human originality ratings from the same task. The results indicated that while mood induction effectively altered participants’ self-reported arousal and valence, no significant differences in flexibility or originality were observed across mood conditions. However, correlational and multilevel regression analyses suggested two distinct modes of flexibility: persistent exploratory breadth and adaptive switching. Crucially, only adaptive switching flexibility measures significantly predicted originality. Together, these results raised caveats on transient mood manipulations in creativity research, while illuminating the value of process-level, adaptive flexibility as a core mechanism underlying originality. Moreover, it demonstrates the utility of integrating drawing-based tasks with artificial intelligence to capture the dynamic, cross-modal mechanisms underpinning original thoughts.",2025,"Cong, Tianyue"
macss_05,Mapping Informality and Violence: Machine Learning Insights into Crime Patterns Across South African Police Jurisdictions,"This study examines the relationship between neighborhood informality and crime rates in South Africa, where rapid urbanization has led to criminal organizations stepping in to provide services within some of these settlements. Applying K-means clustering and Local Moran’s I analysis to 1,164 police jurisdictions, we observe that the cluster with the highest level of informality also exhibited the lowest crime rates. Furthermore, in clusters representing moderately dense urban areas, linear regression reveals a statistically significant negative correlation between levels of informality and crime rates. Machine learning models, including KNN and random forest, show that crime can be predicted with low MSE, with k-complexity emerging as a key feature. Finally, a longitudinal case study on crime and growth data offers further insight into potential causal relationships, though the results are not statistically significant. These findings have implications for urban governance and public safety policies in developing countries.",2025,"Liang, Yingyi"
macss_06,Locked In or Lifted Up? Impact of Kenya land settlement plan on long-term economics development,"This paper examines the long-term effects of Kenya’s post-independence land settlement policy, focusing on the ""Million Acre Scheme,"" a large-scale redistribution initiative implemented in the 1960s. Using a geographic regression discontinuity (RD) design and multiple waves of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, the study evaluates how formal land rights granted through the settlement program have shaped economic development outcomes over time. The analysis links a newly digitized historical map of settlement boundaries to geocoded household data and reveals that individuals living within settlement areas exhibit significantly higher wealth levels but lower educational attainment—particularly among women and those located far from markets. These results suggest that while land tenure security may have spurred investment and asset accumulation, it also constrained household mobility and reduced incentives to invest in human capital. The findings underscore the importance of balancing tenure formalization with broader access to economic and educational opportunities when designing land reform policy.",2025,"Hui, Yu"
macss_07,Financing Under a Mandatory Single-payer Universal Health Insurance System,"This paper develops a stylized two-part tariff model to evaluate the fiscal and distributional effects of introducing income-based coinsurance in Egypt’s new Universal Health Insur- ance System (UHIS). Using 2019/20 Household Income, Expenditure and Consumption Survey (HIECS) data, I derive closed-form expressions for household reservation prices for healthcare under mandatory premium payments and calibrate the model with empirically estimated demand elasticity. Numerical simulations compare the status-quo design, flat 7 percent premiums and 10 percent coinsurance with broad medical exemptions, to alter- native schedules that segment coinsurance by income quintile and decile while imposing financial protection caps. Relative to the simulated baseline deficit of EGP 332 billion, the best-performing decile schedule shrinks the funding gap to EGP 52 billion: an 84 percent improvement. The results demonstrate that coinsurance can operate as a redistributive instrument, not merely a cost-containment device, and offer a tractable framework for other low- and middle-income countries that seek to balance equity and solvency under universal health insurance mandates.",2025,"Abdelbaki, Nour"
macss_08,Intergenerational Educational Spillovers in Pakistan,"Education provides a channel for poverty escape via intergenerational mobility (Zuo et. al, 2023). Pakistan’s stifled mobility and consistent political instability provides an opportunity to learn more about the impact of structural and policy changes on intergenerational mo- bility. This study examines the spillover effects of 1972 nationalization policy on children’s educational outcomes in Pakistan with a particular focus on intergenerational spillovers mediated through fathers’ education. A comprehensive microdataset is used from Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurements (PSLM) 2019-20 survey. To analyze the impact of policy regional level Difference-in-Difference (DiD) approach was adopted. To quantify the causal impact further a complementary Instrumental Variable approach was also uti- lized. Findings suggests that 1972 nationalization policy improved educational access in restricted sample case, especially in rural areas with meagre 0.33 additional schooling on average. Whereas, IV approach reveal that Fathers’ education showed strong intergener- ational spillovers, as an additional year of schooling increased a child’s education by 1.03 years. However, DiD results suggested that overall educational attainment decline was ob- served post policy. Additionally, impact on child’ earning outcomes also confirms that just the supply side reforms are not sufficient for interegenerational mobility unless high quality of schooling is also ensured.",2025,"Zeb, Sania"
macss_09,Concept Over Craft: The Acceleration of Creative Peaks in Early 20th Century Modernism,"This study identifies a historical shift in classical music from experimentalism to conceptualism, particularly between Late Romanticism/Impressionism and Early 20th Century Modernism. Using professional performance frequency since 1996 as a retrospective measure of innovation, we estimate composer-level age-performance profiles for 35 canonical figures. Regression results reveal significant lifecycle differences: pre-1874 composers peaked later, consistent with sustained technical refinement, whereas post-1874 Modernists peaked notably earlier, often in their twenties, reflecting conceptual innovation. These findings persist through various robustness checks, controlling for instrumentation, duration, composer identity, and calendar year effects. The results support Galenson’s theory of artistic archetypes and highlight how shifting aesthetic values profoundly influenced both the timing and historical recognition of musical creativity.",2025,"Cui, Yuanhan"
macss_10,What stop people from taking an ‘almost free’ COVID-19 vaccine?,"This essay explores why the COVID-19 vaccine take-up rate is relatively lower in the adult group, despite its benefits and effectiveness. Leveraging a Berry-Levinsohn-Pakes (BLP) demand framework, I estimate how local pandemic severity and demographic factors shape individual’s vaccination behavior across states. The analysis reveals that disadvantaged groups—those with lower education, poorer health, and unemployment—are more likely to postpone their vaccination plans, while younger individuals are more responsive to changes in perceived risk. These findings call for careful policy design that accounts for spatial and age-specific heterogeneity in vaccination hesitancy.",2025,"Wang, Weiqi"
macss_11,Analysis of Moral Language in Self-Improvement Discourse through Natural Language Processing,"Self-improvement consists of making efforts to improve various traits such as health, appear- ance, efficiency, etc. Previous research has identified that popular culture is increasingly portraying aspects of self-improvement as obligations, as if they were moral requirements. This moralization can create stigmatization or be prejudicial when it fosters self-obsession and perfectionism (Coeckelbergh, 2022; Kraaijeveld & Jamrozik, 2022). Recent social me- dia studies have identified these issues among small samples of users, so the present work aims to contribute to the literature by expanding the scope and assessing if the findings of smaller studies hold true in a broader social media context and considering more self- improvement areas (Bell et al., 2024; Camacho-Mi˜nano & Gray, 2021; Coeckelbergh, 2022). Due to the speed of information flow and norms diffusion on the internet, social media platforms are relevant spots to observe the transmission of self-improvement ideas (Puryear et al., 2025). The guiding research questions for the analyses are: (1) Is moral language present in discussions about self-improvement? (2) Are there specific topics within self- improvement discussions that tend to be framed with a higher moral tone? and (3) How is the use of moral language associated with emotions in the context of self-improvement? To answer these questions, data from the subreddit r/selfimprovement was analyzed us- ing the LIWC software, the Moral Foundations Dictionary, and MoralBERT. Furthermore, LDA topic modeling was utilized for uncovering topics and comparing moralization among them. Findings suggest that the r/selfimprovement subreddit contains higher moral lan- guage, particularly among social-related topics and health & fitness discussions. Moreover, content with higher moral language was found to show higher negative emotion and anger language, supporting previous work on the risks of moralization. However, results also suggest that engagement with moral ideas within self-improvement may not be as negative when approached from a reflective and thoughtful perspective.",2025,"Carpio Castellanos, Natasha"
macss_12,A Review of Relationships of Cannabis Legalization With Alcohol Use and Consumption,"The legalization of marijuana, especially recreational cannabis legalization(RCL) has become prevalent in the States. The causation effect of RCL on alcohol use or consumption has aroused public attention widely, and the relevance of the two substances is essential to all aspects of society including economic development, public health issues, and taxation. Therefore, the review summarizes the recent studies’ results and conclusions to reveal the causation effect of recreational marijuana legalization on alcohol use.Online literature Research was performed for articles published in the last five years of English in main datasets. After abstract reviewing and full-text reviewing, 12 studies are included to compare the results in research on the effect.",2025,"Tang, Ziheng"
macss_13,Challenging Dual-Coding Theory: Picture Superiority Effect Persists in Aphantasia,"Dual-coding theory proposes that superior memory for pictures compared to words (the ‘picture superiority effect’) and concrete words compared to abstract words (the ‘concrete- ness effect’) both stem from the ability to store information as verbal and image codes in memory. According to the theory, having two distinct memory codes increases recall prob- ability, as either code can independently lead to successful retrieval, and one code can serve to cue the other. The current study tests this theoretical explanation by examining recall performance in individuals with aphantasia—the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery. Based on dual-coding theory, aphantasic individuals should show neither picture superiority nor concreteness effects due to these individuals’ inability to generate mental images and retrieve image-based memory codes. We recruited 62 aphantasic individuals and 69 typical imagers who completed a memory task with free recall of studied stimuli. Data were analyzed using mixed ANOVA and planned comparison t-tests. We compared recall performance between aphantasic and typical imagers across four stimulus types: pictures, symbols, concrete words, and abstract words. Despite their mental imagery deficit, aphan- tasic individuals demonstrated a robust picture superiority effect. Moreover, while typical populations show similar recall for pictures and symbols, aphantasic individuals displayed superior recall for symbols compared to pictures, perhaps because symbols’ simpler visual properties enable more efficient encoding through alternative strategies like motor imagery. In addition, both aphantasics and controls showed better performance with abstract relative to concrete words—contrary to typical concreteness effects—possibly because our abstract words had corresponding everyday symbols that made them more readily processed despite imagery limitations. These recall patterns across different stimuli in aphantasics challenge dual-coding theory’s explanation that superior recall for visual stimuli stems primarily from the formation and retrieval of supplementary image codes, indicating that either dual-coding is incorrect and some other non-dual-coding mechanism is responsible, or that, at the very least, dual-coding theory requires substantial modification to account for our present find- ings. This study provides novel insights into the relation between mental imagery and memory, challenging traditional theoretical frameworks and suggesting the need for alter- native explanations of these well-established memory phenomena.",2025,"Yan, Muhan"
macss_14,Predicting Clinical Trial Completion and Success using Machine Learning and NLP,"This study introduces a dual-task machine learning framework for predicting both the opera- tional completion and scientific success of clinical trials using data from ClinicalTrials.gov. Leverag- ing structured trial metadata and unstructured textual descriptions, we develop predictive models that assess whether trials are likely to complete and whether they meet their primary endpoints. For the first task, ensemble models like XGBoost significantly outperform traditional baselines, partic- ularly when enriched with contextual embeddings derived from BioLinkBERT. For the second task, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven annotation pipeline using GPT-4o-mini to label trial success based on publication content. Human evaluation confirms its high accuracy. Across both tasks, our framework demonstrates the value of combining structured features, natural language processing, and scalable LLM-based labeling to improve the understanding and forecast- ing of clinical trial performance. This approach not only enhances predictive accuracy but also contributes to better utilization of large-scale biomedical data.",2025,"Li, Jiazheng"
macss_15,Between ‘Hukou’ and ‘I Do’: How the 2014 Hukou Reform Reshapes China’s Marriage Market,"n this paper, I study how the 2014 relaxation of China’s household registration (Hukou) restrictions reshaped the marriage market for internal migrants. The reform significantly eased the requirements for obtaining local Hukou in non-megacities, while megacities re- tained strict controls. Exploiting this institutional change, I use a difference-in-differences framework to compare marriage outcomes between treatment cities (cities with population below 5 million) and control cities (cities with population above 5 million). I find that, after the reform, migrants in treatment cities became less likely to marry local Hukou holders, and the educational gap between spouses narrowed. These results suggest that the value of Hukou status as a marriage-matching advantage declined when local registration became easier to obtain. As a result, individuals placed more emphasis on non-institutional traits, such as education, when selecting partners.",2025,"Zhang, Weiran"
macss_16,Seasonal Influences on Regional Consumer Satisfaction: A Computational Analysis of Yelp Reviews,"This study investigates how consumer satisfaction in the restaurant sector varies across seasonal periods and geographic contexts, using over one million Yelp reviews from Philadelphia and Tampa—two cities with distinct climatic and economic profiles. By integrating structured data (star ratings) with unstructured data (text-based sentiment scores), the analysis applies sentiment analysis, Ordinary Least Squares regression, ordered logistic models, and Random Forests to detect spatiotemporal patterns in consumer evaluations. Results show that satisfaction is generally higher in warmer seasons, but the strength of seasonal effects differs across cities, with Tampa exhibiting greater seasonal variation than Philadelphia. Sentiment scores are more sensitive to seasonal shifts than star ratings, and systematic divergence between the two emerges across cities and seasons. These findings suggest that economic structures, such as tourism reliance, may shape satisfaction more than climate alone, and highlight how textual analysis captures emotional nuance often masked by numeric ratings. The study also demonstrates how combining structured and unstructured data can reveal nonlinear and context-dependent satisfaction dynamics that conventional models may overlook. This contributes to consumer research by offering an integrated framework for modeling seasonal and geographic variation in satisfaction and by validating the utility of sentiment analysis in large-scale behavioral studies. Practical implications for service management and design are discussed, and future research directions are proposed to extend this work across diverse service contexts and environmental conditions.",2025,"Zhang, Kexin"
macss_17,Investigating the Pathways from World Trade Center Exposures to COVID-19 Severity and Long-Term Sequelae,"Our study examined the associations between WTC exposures and COVID outcomes using two analyses: one focused on COVID severity and the other on post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which is known as long COVID. In the severity analysis, our aggregate exposure measure revealed that a significant portion of the effect on COVID severity is mediated by obstructive airway disease (OAD), indicating that impaired respiratory health is a key pathway linking WTC exposures to more severe acute illness. In the PASC analysis, we found that the overall effect of WTC exposures on long COVID is largely mediated by impaired respiratory health. These findings suggest that while OAD is a critical mediator for both COVID severity and PASC, additional mechanisms likely contribute to long-term outcomes.",2025,"Yu, Bin"
macss_18,Emotional and Cultural Patterns Expressed in Chinese and Japanese Cuisines in U.S. Consumer Reviews,"Ethnic restaurants in the United States hold significant cultural and social meanings, being widely embraced by diverse communities. As these restaurants adapt to American dietary habits, they not only reflect but also influence culinary trends. Chinese cuisine has long been a popular choice among American diners, while Japanese cuisine has increasingly captured the attention of consumers. This growing interest can be traced back to the 1980s and 1990s, when chefs began incorporating Japanese ingredients and culinary techniques into their menus, a phenomenon known as the “Japanese turn.” By the twenty-first century's second decade, concepts like umami and shun had become familiar to many American chefs (yamashita, 2020). This thesis investigates how U.S. consumer reviews on Google reflect differing perceptions of Chinese and Japanese cuisines, focusing on emotional tone, word choice, and cultural framing. Using a dataset of over 690,000 reviews, the study applies TF-IDF, log-odds ratio, and Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis to identify distinct linguistic and emotional patterns associated with each cuisine. The findings reveal that consumer language around Chinese cuisine tends to reflect habitual, everyday experiences, suggesting symbolic assimilation, whereas Japanese cuisine is more frequently framed through cultural markers and positive emotional descriptors—indicating a retained sense of ethnic distinctiveness. This study contributes to broader discussions of authenticity, emotional evaluation, and cultural stratification in consumer discourse, showing how digital reviews both mirror and construct cultural narratives around ethnic food in the U.S.",2025,"Yin, Yue"
macss_19,"Understanding Bullet Chat Moderation on Bilibili: Patterns, Effects, and Implications","On the popular Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili, users can post live comments that float across video streams or broadcasts—a unique interaction known as ''bullet chat''. This real-time commenting system is actively moderated by an automated scoring mechanism known as the ''censor score'', which assigns each comment a value from 1 to 10, reflecting its likelihood of being censored based on content appropriateness. This study investigates how moderation on Bilibili varies according to user identity, emotional sentiment of comments, and topic sensitivity. By analyzing publicly available moderation data and employing large-scale sentiment classification methods, we discovered distinct moderation patterns. We found that severity of penalties differ substantially depending on the type of violation and the imposer of the penalty (System detect versus Human detect). Moreover, accounts with different certifications—such as government entities versus individual influencers—exhibit significantly different censor scoring trends even within the same discussion topics. Institutional accounts, generally received higher censor scores, suggesting variations in moderation standards tied to user identity and content context.",2025,"Shen, Yang"
macss_20,Papaya Privacy: Empowering Web Users through AI-enabled Cookie Consent and Data Monetization Tools,"The current online advertising data ecosystem is broken. Web-users are repeatedly deceived by dark design patterns into clicking “Accept All” on cookie consent banners, unwittingly opting in to a myriad of unintended data flows. These data flows can have drastic consequences, ranging from targeted advertisement all the way to social oppression. To combat these problems, we present Papaya Privacy, a new way to empower web-users using AI-powered cookie consent and data monetization mechanisms. We designed and implemented two interventions, Agent Papaya and Papaya Payback. With Agent Papaya, our Agentic AI-powered chrome extension, we give users the ability to set their cookie preferences once and execute this seamlessly across websites, mitigating the effects of dark design patterns. With users now able to effectively opt-out of data collection, we conceptualize an alternative data market, Papaya Payback, based on the theories of Data Unions and Contextual Integrity. Through simulation, we show that by allowing users fine-grained control of who gets to access what data of theirs and for what purposes, the Papaya Payback market creates greater social welfare than the current online advertising data market. Together, Papaya Privacy’s two interventions demonstrate a practical path toward a consent-enforcing, user-centered, and economically viable data economy for online advertising.",2025,"Kripa, Ram M."
macss_21,From Pixels to Preferences: Mixed Logit Demand Estimation Using Product Image Embeddings for E-Commerce,"Accurately estimating substitution patterns in e-commerce is difficult because most demand models rely on hand-coded product attributes that are often missing or incomplete. I propose a multimodal-embedding approach that replaces those attributes with low-dimensional features extracted from product images and texts by pre-trained deep-learning models. Embedding principal components are entered—alongside price—into a mixed logit, allowing visual and textual similarity to discipline cross-price elasticities. Applied to 3,478 Amazon purchases in a 25-item Headsets category, adding just two image principal components from a ResNet-50 encoder lowers the Akaike Information Criterion by 296 points relative to a price-only logit and reduces the out-of-sample mean absolute error of market-share forecasts by 22%. Diversion ratios become more concentrated, raising the category-level Herfindahl–Hirschman Index from 0.073 to 0.088 (+21%), which reveals tighter competition within visually defined sub-segments such as mid-range gaming headsets. These results demonstrate that information already present in product pages can materially improve demand estimation, even when no structured attributes are available.",2025,"Dong, Kaiwen"
macss_22,"Do Cryptocurrency Valuations Reflect Their Technological Innovation? Insights from Marketing, Security, and Code Levels","This thesis investigates how technological innovation influences the valuation of cryptocurrencies, focusing on the top 50 DeFi tokens by market capitalization. To capture the multifaceted nature of blockchain innovation, I construct three distinct indicators: a Whitepaper Innovation Index based on word embedding and clustering techniques, a standardized Audit Security Score derived from rubric-guided evaluation of audit reports, and a Code Maturity Proxy based on GitHub fork counts. These metrics are combined with financial data from CoinMarketCap and project-level metadata including blockchain architecture classification, academic involvement, historical volatility, and token age. Cross-sectional regression analysis shows that the proposed innovation indicators—while theoretically meaningful—do not exhibit statistically significant relationships with either market capitalization or trading volume. Instead, token age emerges as the most robust and consistent predictor across specifications, indicating that investor behavior is more responsive to project longevity than to technical complexity. Historical volatility is also negatively associated with market capitalization, suggesting that market participants tend to penalize assets with unstable pricing histories. The results suggest that, within the current market landscape, signals of maturity and stability outweigh detailed technical disclosures in shaping investor perception. This study contributes to the empirical literature by introducing a structured, multi-dimensional framework for evaluating technological innovation in crypto assets and by shedding light on the behavioral cues that dominate pricing dynamics in decentralized finance.",2025,"Cui, Xiaotong"
macss_23,The Effect of Monetary Policy Shocks on Stock Returns and Firm Characteristics in the US,"This thesis studies the effect of monetary policy shocks on stock price change before and after FOMC meetings. Results show that contractionary monetary policy surprise cause negative asset returns on average, vice versus. I also found that reactions of individual stocks to monetary shocks are not fully explained by Fama French five-factor model. Then, results show that size, profitability, book leverage, current ratio, and current liabilities ratio are related to stock prices change induced by monetary policy surprise.",2025,"Zou, Yang"
macss_24,Displacement of Online Communities by Artificial Intelligence: The Impact of ChatGPT on Stack Exchange,"This study explores the impact of ChatGPT on Stack Exchange's sustainability and community health by analyzing data from 40 communities from September 2021 to September 2023. In the community-level analysis, we used the difference-in-differences method, utilizing the previous year's data to construct the control group. We found the launch of ChatGPT significantly decreased the number of new posts on the platform, with the rollout of GPT-4 intensifying this effect. Additionally, our findings indicate notable heterogeneity in the impacts of GPT across various communities. Technology communities experienced the most significant negative effects. In the user-level analysis, we found the reduction in post numbers primarily resulted from decreased activity among users registered in the last two years. Subsequently, we used the Temporal Causal Inference (Turjeman and Feinberg, 2023) method using data from users who registered 1-6 months earlier to construct control groups and conducted regressions using the Difference-in-Differences and Generalized Synthetic Control Method. We identified the effect of GPT by comparing the number of posts from users with different registration times during the same registered duration. We found the negative GPT effect consistent with previous results, and it is more pronounced among users with higher community status and more social interaction.",2024,"Xie, Hongzhang"
macss_25,Familiarity Breeds Complexity: The Impact of Brand Loyalty on E-Commerce Advertising and Promotion Decisions,"This study investigates the impact of consumers' brand loyalty on sellers' promotional and advertising strategies on China's leading e-commerce platform, Taobao. Utilizing a unique dataset in 2013, the research examines how sellers adjust their behaviors in response to the proportion of familiar consumers, a direct measure of loyalty. The study extends Agrawal's (1996) game-theoretical framework, testing the hypothesis that seller with smaller proportion of loyal consumers increase promotional frequency and advertising spending as the loyalty size increase. The research innovatively addresses the challenge of reverse causality by using the platform algorithm as an instrumental variable. Empirical findings support the hypotheses, providing new insights into the relationship between brand loyalty and seller behavior in e-commerce. The paper contributes to the literature on firm responses to consumer loyalty, offering practical implications for marketing strategies in digital marketplaces.",2024,"Hu, Yunshu"
macss_26,Unlocking Drivers behind Stock Price Movements: Apply Structural Deep Learning to Predict Operating Profitability from Text Data,"In empirical asset pricing, traditional numerical firm characteristics often fall short in fully encapsulating firms’ performances, as highlighted by Ralph (2023). To address this limi- tation, researchers have increasingly turned to alternative data sources, such as news, 10K filings, conference calls, to augment predictive models for stock price movements (Gabaix et al., 2023; Glodd & Hristova, 2023). In this project, we leverage structural deep learning techniques to combine LLama2 embeddings of conference call transcripts with traditional numerical features to generate operating profitability as a novel stock price predictor. We hypothesize that the new variable, predicted operating profitability, informed by rich textual data, can capture additional insights into firms’ true potential (Feldman et al., 2020; Kim & Nikolaev, 2023). By delving into the neural network’s predictive capabilities from tex- tual data, this study contributes to empirical asset pricing literature as well as the ongoing exploration of applying neural networks to discover drivers behind stock price fluctuations.",2024,"Chen, Kangyi"
macss_27,Linking Rent Regulation to Housing Quality in New York City 2017-2021,"This thesis examines the spatial distribution of rent-regulated housing and housing mainte- nance code violations and explores the spatial spillover effects of rent regulation on property upkeep. It also analyzes changes in housing conditions before and after the implementation of the Rent Law of 2019, which made it more difficult for property owners to deregulate properties. Utilizing spatial clustering and regression analyses of data from New York City, the study reveals: (1) a spatial overlap and clustering of rent-regulated housing and housing maintenance code violations; (2) a negative impact of rent regulation on housing quality that extends beyond individual census tracts to neighboring areas; and (3) potential exac- erbation of housing maintenance issues following the enactment of stricter rent regulation laws. These findings suggest challenges of rent regulation policies to balance affordability with quality and that these policies might disproportionately affect low-income households who are vulnerable to displacement and rely on rent regulations for housing stability in gentrifying neighborhoods.",2024,"Lin, Henry"
macss_28,Large-scale Linguistic Mimicry: Evaluating Persuasion Efficiency of Large Language Models,"Interacting with millions of global users, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Chat- GPT may possess unprecedented capabilities for automated, personalized persuasion at scale. Are LLMs actually good at personalized persuasion? Do they become more persua- sive when they personalized the texts to match users’ linguistic patterns? This research undertakes to evaluate the personalized persuasion potentials of LLMs when they learn to speak like users. We assess GPT-4’s mimicry capability against mimicry naturally occur- ring in human interaction and evaluate linguistically personalized persuasion’s effectiveness through a survey experiment. Results show GPT-4’s proficiency in linguistic mimicry akin to humans, yet linguistically personalized arguments aren’t more effective than general ones. Our approach underscores the importance of domain expertise in eliciting model capabilities and constructing evaluations for governing frontier AI systems.

macss_29,A Multidimensional Analysis of Language Model Sentiment and Self-Reported Emotional States,"This thesis presents a multidimensional analysis of the relationship between sentiment as evaluated by a large language model (RoBERTa) and self-reported emotional states during mind-wandering episodes. The study utilized data from the Audiovisual Attention (AVA) study, which captured the spontaneous speech of participants. The RoBERTa model was employed to quantify the emotional valence of this speech, categorizing it into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. In parallel, self-reported measures were taken, allowing for a comparison between computational sentiment analysis and participant self-assessment. Findings demonstrate that while both approaches provide valuable insights, they offer complementary information regarding the emotional valence of thoughts. The research highlights the prevalence of neutral sentiments in mind-wandering and the model’s accuracy in classifying emotional tones, suggesting the potential of natural language processing tools in psychological research.",2024,"Ding, Xiaochen"
macss_30,Gender Identity and Representation in the Context of Economic Development in India,"Does legislators' gender identity affect representation, indicated by their participation in legislative activity? I ask whether their gender impacts the extent to which elected representatives present and relay issues to seek government action on. Are females inherently different as legislators in the democracy? This project uses a natural language processing approach along with a dynamic difference-in-differences strategy to investigate. Using a zero-shot classification technique, I create five outcome ``scores'' to evaluate the Indian Parliament's textual Question Hour data on: development, corruption, accountability \& transparency, programmatic representation, and clientilistic representation. The analysis reveals that female representation has minimal to no discernible normalized average total effect per treatment unit on development scores. Slight negative effects are observed in the cases of programmatic and clientelistic representation scores. However, a modest negative effect on accountability and transparency scores contradicts expectations, suggesting nuanced interactions that may not universally improve governance quality through increased female representation. In addition, the only positive effect, though small, on corruption scores reveals the priorities of female representation over time periods. These findings underscore the complexity of gender effects across different governance dimensions and temporal contexts, highlighting the importance of individual temporal effects and their association with specific electoral cycles in informing the dynamism in representation in developing contexts.",2024,"Pandey, Bhavya"
macss_31,Unveiling Attrition: Using Predictive Modeling to Investigate Key Drivers of Voluntary Employee Turnover at a Mid-Size Global Food and Beverage Organization,"Voluntary employee turnover, or attrition, can be a significant impediment to the effective functioning of an organization. With each employee replacement, time and money are spent to search for and train a new hire, so companies strive to identify areas that lead to turnover and effectively plan for its occurrence. Academics in organizational psychology and management studies have produced extensive literature on this issue, often taking the approach of identifying variables that range from employee-specific to industry-wide. However, results are not consistent at the company level, as each organization is placed in a unique context. As a result, companies benefit the most from conducting analysis using their historical data. The present study implemented this approach by determining the most significant drivers of employee turnover at a mid-size food and beverage organization (“the Company”). Given 6 years of data on employee attributes and turnover, this study used various interpretable machine learning models to point to key correlates of voluntary turnover in addition to generating predicted probabilities based on the current workforce. This analysis drove the main deliverable, presented to the Company in the form of a slide deck, which visualizes the relationships between significant variables and voluntary turnover. Additionally, turnover forecasts for 2024 were generated. The models used in this study showed strong predictive ability, with consistent variables emerging as significant across various model types. This analysis highlights areas of interest that are predictive of voluntary turnover while identifying further opportunities for inquiry.",2024,"Corey, Sam"
macss_32,Shifts in Yelp Sentiments and Ratings After a Restaurant's Michelin Star Announcement,"In the digital age, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer decisions, particularly in the high-end dining sector where Michelin stars serve as a hallmark of culinary excellence. This study investigates the impact of Michelin star awards on consumer feedback on Yelp, focusing on changes in sentiment and ratings across multiple dimensions of the dining experience—food, service, price, and ambiance. Utilizing a quantitative approach, the research analyzes Yelp review data from restaurants in the United States awarded Michelin stars, employing sentiment analysis and statistical methods to assess the post-award shifts in consumer feedback. The findings reveal that Michelin stars do not uniformly affect all restaurants; while higher-tier establishments generally experience stable or improved ratings, one-star restaurants often see a decline post-award. This study suggests that Michelin stars significantly enhance sentiments towards service quality and perceived value for money, particularly in higher-starred restaurants. Conversely, sentiments related to ambiance and food, although positive, show minimal changes directly attributable to the Michelin recognition. This study contributes to the understanding of the Michelin effect within the digital landscape of consumer feedback, highlighting the complex interplay between prestigious accolades and eWOM. The research underscores the importance of managing customer expectations in the aftermath of receiving a Michelin star, particularly concerning pricing and value perception. For future research, this study suggests the need for longitudinal analyses to capture long-term effects and recommends incorporating qualitative methods to delve deeper into consumer motivations and perceptions. The findings hold significant implications for restaurateurs, who must navigate the heightened expectations associated with Michelin recognition, and for academics, pointing to the evolving dynamics of consumer behavior in the realm of luxury dining.",2024,"Song, Zhixuan"
macss_33,Grandparents and the Gender Gap: How does grandparent-provided childcare affect parents’ employment in China?,"This paper explores the impact of grandparental childcare on labor market gender inequalities in China, particularly focusing on how grandmothers' involvement influences maternal employment outcomes. Employing a three-agent simultaneous choice model within a three-generational family framework, this study integrates theoretical analysis with empirical evidence from the China Family Panel Studies. The empirical analysis utilizes a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to examine the effects of a grandparent's death on parental employment decisions. My findings reveal that the loss of grandparental childcare, especially following the death of a grandmother, significantly reduces mothers' labor participation and income. This research underscores the critical role of grandparents in the labor market dynamics and highlights the necessity for policy interventions to support working families, addressing broader issues of gender inequality in China.",2024,"Wang, Xi"

macss_35,Living in the Hub: A Platform Study of Desire Semantics,"Since the late 2000s, the world has experienced an unprecedented platformization of cultural production. Cultural content is created, disseminated, and consumed on online platforms, leading to a state wherein algorithmic systems and coding infrastructure primarily mediate interaction with audiovisual media. The question this thesis addresses is how we can use existing algorithmic and software systems within platforms to study sexual desire and sexuality or, at the very least, the lust of their users. To do so, I assess the social norms unfolding within the content categorization and recommendation systems of Pornhub, a popular pornographic video online platform. My methodological approach is multi-modal since observational data (collected and found) are combined with interpretation and digital experiments. Conventional content analysis methods, such as term frequencies or semantic networks, are limited in their ability to capture the nuances of video category semantics. To work around this, I use a custom word embedding model treating categories as the model’s “vocabulary” and mapping them to a 100-dimensional semantic space in which similar words appear in proximity. Results showcase a promising and detailed semantic understanding of category meaning that can be further applied in studies of algorithmic bias of the platform’s video recommendations.",2024,"Bitsikokos, Loizos"
macss_36,Body Positivity vs. Fitspiration: Comparing the Video Content and Comments on YouTube,"Background: The emergence of social media has revolutionized the discourse surrounding body image, particularly through trends like fitspiration and body positivity. While fitspiration often emphasizes physical appearance and restrictive behaviors, the trend of body positivity emerged to challenge societal ideals and promote acceptance. However, there are controversies as to whether the trend of body positivity has delivered its promise. Despite extensive research, direct comparisons between these trends on platforms like YouTube remain scarce. This study addresses this gap by analyzing fitspiration and body positivity content and comments on YouTube. This study aims to provide insights into various aspects of fitspiration and body positivity content on YouTube, including their popularity, content themes, and sentiment in comments.
Data: This study gathered textual data, including video titles, descriptions, user-defined content tags, and comments, as well as contextual data such as video view count, comment count, duration, and category, from the most viewed fitspiration and body positivity YouTube videos using the YouTube API. The data covered videos published between 2013 and 2023, with the 11-year period divided into equal half-year windows. The videos were sampled using the keywords “fitspo” and “fitspiration” for fitspiration samples, and “bodypositive” and “bodypositivity” for body positivity samples, within specified half-year time windows. In total, 1045 fitspiration videos and 752 body positivity videos were analyzed, along with 7997 fitspiration comments and 13776 body positivity comments.
Methods: The study employed a mixed-methods approach to analyze various aspects of video content and comments on YouTube. For popularity and duration comparison, descriptive analysis was conducted on sample volume, view count, comment count, and video duration. This involved examining the overall distribution and trends of these variables across different years and topics. For video topic comparisons, the distribution of video categories and frequently used hashtags was examined to understand the types of content and trends within each topic. Additionally, cluster analysis was performed to evaluate cohesion within each trend and distinction between trends. For comment analysis, pre- trained Large Language Models (LLMs) were deployed to analyze the sentiment of comments and used to identify prominent themes present in the comments, shedding light on the topics and sentiments expressed by viewers.
Results: Popularity and Duration Comparison: The number of body positivity videos published on YouTube steadily increased from 2013 to 2019. On average, body positivity videos garnered higher view counts, comment counts, and likes compared to fitspiration videos. In the recent three years (2021 to 2023), body positivity videos reached their highest average view count and comment count over the 11-year period. Conversely, fitspiration videos exhibited a more stable trend in average view count with no noticeable overall growth. Topic Comparison: The “People & Blogs” category emerged as the most prominent video category for both topics. However, the most notable contrast was observed in the “Sport” category, which constituted over 23% of fitspiration videos but less than 2% of body positivity videos. Sentiment Comparison of Comments: The majority of comments under both fitspiration and body positivity videos exhibited positive sentiments. However, body positivity videos had a higher proportion of negative comments. Themes Comparison of Comments: The majority of comments across both topics were found to have the prominent theme of Gratitude or Appreciation for Content, followed by Physical Appearance or Body Shape/Parts. Physical Appearance or Body Shape/Parts comments were less positive and more negative than average in sentiment; they tend to be more negative in body positivity than fitspiration. Body Functionality emerged as the third most common prominent theme in fitspiration comments, but was only marginal in body positivity comments. The body positivity constructs Conceptualize Beauty Broadly and Encouragement of Body Acceptance were more frequently found in body positivity comments than fitspiration ones. However, half of Conceptualize Beauty Broadly comments in body positivity were negative. Personal life story sharing was the third most frequent theme in body positivity; however, it was also the most negative theme across the ten themes.
Conclusions: Body positivity videos on YouTube have surged in popularity in recent years, peaking between 2021 and 2023, while fitspiration videos have shown more stable viewership trends. A key difference between the two trends is the emphasis on body positivity versus physical exercise. However, it’s noteworthy that a significant portion of body positivity comments exhibit negative sentiment, particularly those focusing on Conceptualizing Beauty Broadly. Surprisingly, body positivity content often centers more on physical appearance than fitspiration content. This emphasis on appearance correlates with higher rates of negative sentiment in body positivity comments. Additionally, personal life story sharing is prevalent in body positivity discussions, with a notable proportion reflecting negative experiences. These findings highlight concerns about body positivity discourse online and suggest avenues for further research, particularly in understanding the impact of these interactions on viewers.

macss_37,"Intergenerational Changes in Education and Social Mobility in Contemporary China: Based on Gender, Area and Family Size","This study explores the significant changes of the gender gap, regional divide, and family size effect in the context of intergenerational education improvement and social mobility after the launch of China's reform and open-up policy. The reform and open-up policy, initiated in 1978 China, introduced significant social changes including increased urbanization, changes in family structure, shifts in social norms and values. This study will contribute valuable insights into how such large-scale national policy shape and affect social structures and patterns of mobility among different groups of population, and either reinforce or mitigate forms of social inequality. Therefore, intergenerational education improvement and social mobility are the main focuses as well as key indicators in this study to measure the prevalence, magnitude and changes of the gender gap, regional disparities, and family size effect. This study utilizes data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative, longitudinal household survey of over 14,000 families in contemporary China, and mainly multi-linear regression models with interactive effects to investigate the impact of the reform and opening policy. The results of this study indicates that while there are still social inequality and differences among different population groups in modern China, these differences to some extent have been effectively and significantly reduced over time with the influence of the reform and opening policy.",2023,"Chen, Zhibin"

The research’s pivotal contribution lies in the newly developed experimen- tation platform, enabling effective data gathering and testing of popular interventions against misinformation using adaptive experimentation.",2023,"Hosamane, Sudhamshu"
macss_39,TOWARD A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO EX-ANTE FTA IMPACT ESTIMATION ANALYSIS,"A standard approach to the analysis of free trade agreements (FTAs) involves simulating a general equilibrium model of the global economy in response to shocks that reflect trade cost liberalisation. A few methods are common to estimate the scale of these essential trade shocks, but little formal research has gone into evaluating the success of these different approaches. Developing a systematic approach to the evaluation of FTA trade shock estimates is essential to informed policy making in international trade, as well as to the academic literature on the evaluation of FTAs. This paper contributes to the existing small literature focused on estimating trade impacts for use in economic modelling of trade. It extends a framework first used in a paper by [Baier et al., 2019]. This method presented a novel way to evaluate ex-ante trade shock estimation methodologies by posing the issue as a prediction problem to predict ex-post FTA shocks identified through a first stage gravity model. In this paper I extend the original paper’s ex-ante analysis by making use of a wider dataset, as well as adopting recent methodological innovations from the machine learning literature. I find that amongst the most important considerations in making ex-ante FTA impact estimates are whether a model is trained on data excluding outliers and the type of machine learning model chosen. Furthermore, the broader set of data used is found to be important in improving success.",2023,"Delahaye, Elliot"
macss_40,Open Particles in Social Medium: Open Collaboration in GitHub,"This thesis proposes an innovative approach for the comprehensive and structured modeling of online open collaboration. By conceptualizing individuals, teams, and collaborative environments as social atoms, molecules, and mediums respectively, it employs concepts and tools from physics and chemistry to illustrate human interactions. This research introduces an analogical framework that retains the fundamental principles of select traditional natural science instruments while also integrating more probabilistic and dynamic elements to address the disparities between the physical and social systems. It applies and adapts two tools and one concept from physics and chemistry - namely the collaborative periodic table (inspired by the periodic table of elements), the probabilistic collaboration equation (based on the reaction equation), and the social superposition state (derived from quantum physics). These tools and concepts are employed to study open collaboration on GitHub, leveraging a dataset sourced from the GitHub open-source community that includes collaborative data from hundreds of thousands of users. The findings of this study not only provide deeper insights into the behavior patterns of open collaboration participants but also illuminate a bottom-up strategy for future sociophysical pursuits.",2023,Shiyang Lai

We select three measures of extremism performance supported by prior literature and examine their ability to predict human-labeled extremism in crowd-sourced data. Then we observe how the social media posts’ popularity is dependent on these measures. We find that, out of the three measures, sentiment has a statistically significant association with popularity, but could not yield evidence to confirm it to be a good predictor of extremism.",2023,"Yang, Shuyi"
macss_42,Sentiment Analysis and Stock Market Prediction in China: Based on Commentary Information,"The fluctuation of stock prices affects various aspects of social life, and thus, effective prediction of stock market trends has significant commercial and social value. Generally, predicting future market trends depends on studying and extracting the changing patterns of historical data. In this study, based on 1000 trading days from January 2018 to December 2022 in the Chinese stock market and 6000 stock comments, we propose an LSTM model based on historical financial data and investor sentiment to predict the future trends of the Chinese A-share market index. Firstly, we extend the sentiment lexicon to fit the context of stock market and construct specific matching rules to calculate sentiment scores. Secondly, we construct an LSTM model based on financial data, and compared the prediction results with the traditional ARMA model with the same inputs, where the empirical evidence cannot support the argument that the LSTM models are superior in predicting performance. Finally, we add the sentiment index to the input layer of the LSTM model, and compare the prediction results of the new model and the basic model on the test set, fully showing the significant role of sentiment indicators in predicting market trends.",2023,"Shen, Yucheng"
macss_43,Politics and Gender: The Role Of Female Senator’s Power In Their Advocacy For Women’s Interest,"Although progress has been made in increasing the representation of women in political institutions, their roles in the legislative process remains limited, and substantive representation of women's interests requires not only descriptive representation but also power and influence over the legislative process. The emergence of social media platforms provides a new space for politicians to express their political interests and spread over a wider audience. Examining senators' public rhetoric on social media can provide insights into their potential legislative interests and attention focus, and advocacy for women's interests is crucial in promoting gender equality and social justice. This study investigates whether female senators advocate more for women's interests on social media than their male counterparts and whether female senators with higher leadership roles advocate more for women's interests. However, this study finds that women with higher information control and power do not necessarily advocate for women's interests more frequently, suggesting a tension between leadership and substantive representation of women's interests. Additionally, Republican senators publish significantly fewer statements about women's interests than independent and Democratic senators. This study addresses a gap in current theories regarding the impact of women's power and status on promoting substantive representation of women in the legislative process, particularly on the advocacy for women's interests on social media platforms.",2023,"Wu, Linhui"
macss_44,The Dissemination of Predatory Journals in US Policy Documents,"This study collected and analyzed data on the use of so-called “predatory journals” in US policy documents from January 2017 to October 2022 and investigates the impact of predatory journals on policy decisions by analyzing 1,480,181 policy documents. The findings reveal that predatory journals are cited in policy documents, but at a relatively low rate of 0.5%. However, the study highlights the potential impact that predatory journals can have on policy decisions and suggests that non-government documents may serve as a means of information laundering. Additionally, the proportions of policy documents that cite predatory journal articles are heterogeneous in different topics, with Religion and Belief having the largest proportion followed by Weather. The top 5 cited predatory journals are all from biomedical fields, which is a concerning trend due to their significant public health implications. Moreover, approximately half of the citations on predatory journal articles are from just two journals - Oncotarget and Journal of Physical Therapy Science. The semantic similarity pattern suggests that the information from the original predatory journal articles is disseminated into further policy documents, indicating the existence of information laundering in the collected dataset. Policy makers should be cautious when citing articles from predatory journals and should consider the credibility and reliability of the sources they use to inform their decisions. The results provide insights into the prevalence and potential mechanisms of the use of predatory journals in US policy documents.",2023,"Shi, Haohan"

macss_47,Citations of Low-Credibility News in US Policy Documents (2017~2022),"The advent of the internet has allowed non-institutional actors to release information into the public realm due to reduced gatekeeping. Recently, this has raised concerns about the spread of low-credibility information such as misinformation and fake news. While most research has focused on low-credibility information spreading in the context of social media or mainstream media, less attention has been paid to whether they have been channeled into policy documents. Given the new waves of increasingly partisan think tanks, this study aims to identify the extent to which low-credibility information has also been spreading in policy documents. Using the Overton policy dataset, we identified the citations of low-credibility news sites and traced the citation patterns of those news sites onto congressional committee documents. We find that despite the alarming proportion of low credibility documents cited in policy documents, the channeling of misinformation from fake news articles onto legislation and policy-making is relatively rare, with the exception of “invited speaker” citations. Compared with the social media ecosystem that previous researchers have found to amplify the spread of fake news, the ecosystem of policy documents was found to suppress the spread of it by selecting out problematic misinformation claims at every step of the citation process. These findings provide reassurance that think tanks, while increasingly partisan, have generally not crossed the boundary towards producing misinformation. However, further work is needed to solidify these preliminary findings.",2023,"Ling, Hsin-Keng"
macss_48,The Influence of Investor Sentiment on Stock Volatility: Empirical Tests from the Financial Social Media Platform,"The way investor sentiment engenders specific economic, social, or political ramifications represents the confluence of sociology, economics, and political science as interrelated academic disciplines. The accelerated progression of the Internet has significantly amplified the capacity for investor sentiment dissemination to exert a profound impact on economic and social dynamics. In particular, the emergence of social network platforms such as Twitter and StockTwits has enabled information transmission in virtual space to penetrate more quickly and deeply into the real world. This study analyzes whether investor sentiment on the Internet affects stock market in the real world based on StockTwits big data. The research explores the correlation between investor sentiment derived from social media platforms and stock market behavior, as both factors hold substantial importance in contemporary society. By building a time series model, I conducted an integrated type of analysis of social media data and market data. The results of this study are as follows. Firstly, based on the Granger causality test, investor sentiment within the preceding six trading days has been shown to precipitate stock market volatility, thereby indicating a robust lagging and unidirectional causal relationship between investor sentiment and stock price fluctuations. Second, based on the result of vector auto regression model, investor sentiment of stocks in different sectors is positively or negatively associated with stock market volatility.",2023,"Han, Yulun"
macss_49,Whitening of Milk on Reddit,"Lactose intolerance, a genetic phenomenon that occurs naturally, becomes a controversial topic as some white nationalists make lactose persistence a point of the genetic or racial superiority of White people. This study focuses on analyzing Reddit discourses on lactose intolerance and genetics. It aims to answer the following three questions: Does Reddit discourse on lactose intolerance and genetics expose any evidence of a strong association between whiteness and lactose intolerance? Is there any evidence that reveals the association between lactose intolerance and the feeling of racial inferiority? Is there any evidence revealing that genetic ancestry tests are more like racial projects to support white supremacy? The study uses the combination of quantitative methods, such as LDA topic modeling, word co-occurrence, and a qualitative technique – content analysis to analyze Reddit data related to lactose intolerance and genetics from 2017 to 2022. It finds that Reddit users associate lactose intolerance closely with Asian population and Chinese food is being criticized due to the prevalence of lactose intolerance in Chinese population, whereas European food is privileged. Some users also associate the feeling of inferiority to lactose intolerance, even though the user is aware that lactose intolerance is attribute to genetic mutation. Lastly, genetic testing is often used by some people to prove or confirm their whiteness. This study benefits from using both quantitative and qualitative methods to conduct analysis that requires human interpretation, in the context of social media monitoring on sensitive language and topics related to racism.

macss_51,"Identifying the relationship between oil price, economic development, and carbon emission in the United States ---- Based on TVP-VAR Model","In recent years, a growing number of governments have been adversely affected by excessive carbon emissions, while simultaneously committed to reduce carbon emissions. In order to find the ideal environmental approach, this study used a Time-varying parameter-vector autoregression model to examine the relationship between international oil prices, carbon emissions, and the U.S. economy. According to the study, the international oil price always has a favorable effect on carbon emissions, with the short-term effect being more pronounced. Instead of the unemployment rate, the international oil price always has a favorable effect on the economic growth of the United States. The impact of oil price on the unemployment rate in the United States depends on the political party in power due to divergent attitudes toward the energy business. And the impact of the US GDP on carbon emissions is positive, whereas the impact of the CPI is negative. The relationship between unemployment rate and carbon emissions is also unstable. In addition, by selecting different time points (economic expansion, economic recession, public health catastrophe), we can determine the unique correlations between variables in a variety of contexts. The relationship between oil price and carbon emissions is not the same for public health events. In terms of the influence of oil price on the economy, the initial impact of oil price on GDP during an economic recession is a rise, followed by a decline, because oil price has a less long-term impact than other factors. In times of public health emergency, the impact of oil price on unemployment rate is negative, as the demand for workers in the energy industry increases. Finally, the effect of the economy on carbon emissions is consistent over different time periods, which allows policymakers to foresee the situation and develop effective regulations.

My paper investigates consumerism and individualism in popular song lyrics from 1958 to 2021. By analyzing the lyrics of Billboard Top 100 songs across different genres, I track the frequency of materialistic references, such as luxury items, money, designer brands, food and beverages, and travel and tourism. My study sheds light on the changing cultural values reflected in popular music and explores how these values have evolved. I find that while consumerism and individualism are not explicitly mentioned in many songs, the frequent references to material goods and personal experiences suggest the salience of these concepts in popular culture. Furthermore, my analysis reveals that consumerism and individualism have become more prominent in popular music since the 1980s, with certain genres such as hip hop and funk consistently emphasizing these themes. Overall, my study contributes to our understanding of how popular music reflects and shapes cultural values.",2023,"Tang, Xin"
macss_53,Diagnostic images for mild cognitive impairment reveal biomarker status and abnormal scene processing,"Research on the impairment of episodic memory in AD usually treats all memory contents equally. However, recent studies have revealed that certain images are more diagnostic than other images in classifying whether a person may have AD or its precursors (e.g., mild cognitive impairment, MCI), highlighting the potential insights we may gain when looking at differences across memory content. In this study, we explore whether a set of potentially diagnostic images, for which healthy controls have much higher hit rates than MCI participants, could reflect abnormalities in AD biomarker status and brain processing better than other images. 64 healthy controls and 48 MCI participants in the DELCODE dataset performed a visual scene memory task during fMRI, with CSF AD biomarker data collected (i.e., amyloid and tau biomarkers). We tested whether diagnostic versus non-diagnostic images showed a stronger relationship between behavior and CSF biomarker status, and showed differences in visual patterns during fMRI. We found that diagnostic images have larger behavior-biomarker correlations for total tau, phospho-tau, Aβ42/Aβ40, Aβ42/phospho-tau compared to non-diagnostic images, suggesting that memory for these specific images are more affected by AD pathology. The fMRI data revealed an interaction effect between group membership (healthy control / MCI) and image diagnosticity (diagnostic / non-diagnostic scene images), with MCI participants having higher activation in scene processing regions (PPA, MPA/RSC and OPA) for diagnostic images than non-diagnostic images. In contrast, healthy controls showed no differences in processing between diagnostic and non-diagnostic images. These results suggest that MCI individuals may engage in heightened compensatory activation for these diagnostic images. Our results suggest that diagnostic images are particularly effective at revealing brain pathologies, highlighting direct clinical applications and potential implications for our broader understanding of episodic memory.",2023,"Bai, Yuetong"
macss_54,Mentos Regimes: How Individual Uncertainty Affects the Explosive Strength of Resistance Movements—People are the Real Freshmakers,"This article looks at the empirical data on protests in authoritarian countries as a function of regime type and information control, then constructs an agent based model to examine how the effect of uncertainty can help explain the differences in protest and resistance movements in these differing regime types. The agent based model instantiates two agent types, Citizen and Security, and shows how an inverse relationship between uncertainty with regards acceptable public opposition, the probability of suffering costs, and the ability to accurately perceive local regime support lead to differences in resistance movements. Analysis focuses on the speed of resistance spread between agents as a function of individual agent level uncertainty, and how this affects total resistance size, either full equilibrium flips, i.e. successful revolutions, or protracted unrest. Investigation of empirical data shows reduced frequency of protests in more authoritarian regimes and regimes with higher levels of information control. Modeling dynamics further confirms this behavior and shows a potential connection between lower information control and more frequent but slower spreading, smaller scale resistance events while higher information control is connected with with faster inter-agent resistance spread, and larger resistance levels at a reduced frequency.",2023,"Helbing, Joseph"

Besides, This study also investigates the anomalies of the long-term stagnation of Chinese stock market index and the performance comparison of active fund managers between Chinese and the US’s markets.",2023,"Guangyuan, Chen"
macss_56,Naturalness and Memorability: A Study of Image Similarities and Memorability in Natural and Urban Images,"Interacting with nature is beneficial. Even brief exposures to natural environments or viewing sets of natural scene images can restore attention and memory (Berman et al., 2008). Despite the known benefits of nature, it remains unclear what aspects of viewing nature scenes lead to these improvements. While previous studies focus on the distinction between natural images and non-natural (urban) images, very few examine the connection between distinct properties of natural images and their cognitive benefits. One idea is that natural scenes are more fluently processed, making them less memorable, which in turn contributes to their benefits. A potential confound is that nature scenes may be more confusable than urban scenes, leading to their lower memorability scores predicted by the ResMem Neural Network (Needall & Bainbridge, 2021). The goal of this thesis was to test the hypothesis that image set similarity drives differences in memorability. To test this hypothesis, the present study calculated image statistics and image semantic labels into vectors and determined the Euclidean and cosine distances between pairs of natural and urban images. While the low-level visual features in natural and urban images differ, importantly, there were no significant differences in the average distances of every image pair. However, the semantic similarity analysis showed mixed results. The significant differences in semantic similarity were shown in both direction under different types of label coding techniques. This finding suggests the relationship between image similarity and memorability is more complex than a simple positive or negative relationship. In the future, studies can focus on the processing fluency and memorability of natural images to uncover the mechanism behind their restorative effect.",2023,"Li, Yutai"
macss_57,ALUMNI INFORMATION COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT,"To address the inefficiencies of the existing manual alumni information collection strategy, this thesis proposes an innovative pipeline to automate alumni information collection and identify the prominent alumni in the three MA programs under The University of Chicago’s Social Science Division (SSD). This thesis utilizes computational methods such as web scrap- ing, text cleaning, and natural language processing to collect and verify alumni data through Google API and Selenium. The preliminary analysis unveils critical revelation of the career trajectories and employment outcomes of SSD alumni. Additionally, this thesis proposes a machine-learning-driven approach for industry classification in mentor matching. As an extension of alumni data collection and management that establishes the groundwork for future integration of SSD’s career service and alumni outreach platforms, a prototype of an all-in-one alumni management and networking web application, SSD Connect, is created. This thesis contributes to the body of literature by providing novel methods and insights for automating alumni information collection, managing and analyzing alumni networks, as well as optimizing alumni management and networking strategies for higher education institutions.",2023,"Dang, Lingchen"
macss_58,An Honor or a Curse? Effect of Winning Awards on the Evaluation of Movies’ Quality,"The conventional wisdom is that an increase in status leads to a better evaluation of quality. However, recent research has shown that status can have both positive and negative effects. This study aims to examine the impact of a status increase on perceived quality by proposing two hypotheses: 1) award-winning movies receive less favorable evaluations after the award announcement, and 2) the increase in popularity after the award announcement contributes to the negative effect of a status increase. By using the resources available on IMDB and employing the difference-in-differences approach, I analyzed 47,010 reviews before and after the Oscars Award announcement for both winning and nominated-only movies across seven categories from 2008 to 2019. The results indicate that the ratings and sentiment scores of award-winning movies experienced a more significant decrease. Moreover, an increase in the percentage of reviews predicted that winning movies would receive lower ratings. These findings highlight the need for organizations to be mindful of the divergence in evaluation criteria between experts and the general public and to consider the diverse tastes among lay audiences when evaluating their offerings.",2023,"Chui, Hazel"
macss_59,Big Trouble in Little India: A Computational Temporal Analysis of Singaporean Parliamentary Speeches After the Little India Riot,"In 2013, Singapore’s first riot in 44 years occurred in the racial enclave known as Little India. In response, the Singaporean government spent the next two years debating legislature that ranged from additional security protocols in the neighborhood to broader legislation like the eventually passed Liquor Control Act of 2015. These debates, like others in parliaments around the world, are kept in a repository known as a Hansard – “the official published report od debates in the parliament of a member of the Commonwealth of Nations” (Merriam-Webster). From these repositories, numerous studies explored latent linguistic and semantic elements useful for cultural analysis. A few of these studies employ word embeddings to facilitate closer word-driven analyses, with a smaller number engaging in temporal investigations of the corpus. This paper works to not only extend the literature on the use of word embedding models for the temporal analysis of Hansards but also as a first contribution to a dearth in computationally driven analysis of Singapore’s Hansard. Further, I extracted cultural dimensions of ‘security’ and ‘morality’ and projected selected topics and phrases onto them. To do this, I train a word embedding model on Singapore’s parliamentary speeches from 2012 to 2021, deriving “discourse atoms”, or topics, from said model and using them as reference points for analysis. These results will then be corroborated with textual analysis to communicate a fuller understanding of how exactly these changes are characterized. Overall, I argue that the computational findings point toward an immediate high-level topical response to the riot, that surrounded topics of militarization, inquiry, and disaster. Considered with the textual analysis, the results point toward a shift toward a spatialization of the riot and securitization of the spaces where it occurred in and where its participants, migrant workers, reside and occupy. Further, I argue that this brand of securitization, the securitization of migration, should be more widely used in interrogating government speeches immediately after the riot.",2023,"Ligo, Val Alvern Cueco"
macss_60,Is the News Always Negative? Using Deep Learning to Track News Sentiment During the Covid-19 Pandemic,"The news is notorious for its tendency to focus on negative events, giving rise to the adage, “If it bleeds, it leads.” In this study, I examine whether news coverage during the Covid-19 pandemic mainly focused on negative events while downplaying positive developments such as decreasing Covid-19 cases. Utilizing a state-of-the-art fine-tuned language model, I analyzed the sentiment of over 900,000 Covid-19 related news articles from March 2020 to April 2022 across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The results indicate that the news is far more negative than positive—even when Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations are decreasing. This negativity is most pronounced in Op-Ed articles, front-page news articles, and articles published by large news organizations (e.g., New York Times, BBC, Fox News). However, non-Op-Ed news articles do become more positive as Covid-19 cases decrease, contradicting previous research findings. These discrepancies can be attributed, in part, to differences in model accuracy, as the model I trained is approximately 20% more accurate than other models used in the literature. Further, when dividing U.S. news by the publisher’s political ideology, clear differences emerge: both left-wing and right-wing sources are much more negative than centrist news sources. Surprisingly, these differences in sentiment are about as large as the difference between regular news and Covid-19 news sentiment, indicating substantial differences in news reporting across political lines. These findings provide new insights into news reporting patterns during the pandemic and carry important implications for public health messaging and news reporting practices.",2023,"Nicholson, Gabriel"
macss_61,Using Transfer Entropy to Understand Information Flow and Connectivity in Neural Networks,"One central goal of psychology is to link human behaviors and cognitive processes with concrete neural network. In social science, there is growing interest in understanding social structures through the lens of social network. Though definition of networks and their dynamics are context dependent, the link between network connectivity and dynamics plays a key role in all fields. In this thesis, we study how transfer entropy can elucidate neural network structures. We use transfer entropy to examine two types of model, a network with firing-rate-based nodes with threshold linear transfer function, and a balanced network consisting of leaky integrate-and-fire type neurons. With a firing rate neural model, the effective connectivity inferred by transfer entropy matches the underlying directional network. For balanced networks, presence of connection between two neurons is not predictive of existence of information flow. However, for a balanced network with cluster or layer structures, the multivariate transfer entropy calculation using samples of each neural cluster accurately captures the direction of the cluster-wise projection. We focused on networks in neuroscience, but the framework can be generalized to understand how social network propagates information.",2022,"Zheng, Bowen"
macss_62,How Does Big-data-related Technology Adoption Affect Listed Companies' Market Performance,"This paper investigates the effect of technology adoption on the performance of companies in China. We utilize text-mining techniques to extract information from the annual reports of Chinese A-share listed companies, and particularly, we construct measures of adoption of big data-related technologies based on the occurrences of big-data-related keywords. In conjunction with other company and provincial data, we explore the growth trend, determinants of big-data technology adoption, and the impact of big-data applications on the performance of companies and discuss the possible mechanism for achieving these effects. First, companies with lower tangible assets, higher GDP per capita, or more colleges in their regions are more likely to use big data technology. Second, instrumental variable regression with industry-fixed effects shows that the industry characteristics and nature of the company occasionally limit the positive effects of big data applications. Third, heterogeneity analysis suggests that Big data applications contribute to firm net profit more significantly in the financial and manufacturing industries, and non-state-owned companies.",2022,"Zhang, Yijing"
macss_63,Do Social Media Platforms Impede the Wisdom of Crowds?,"Social media platforms have been playing an increasingly crucial role in shaping social interaction and information exchange. While facilitating communication, they possess the central power that determines which content users are exposed to. In this paper, we examine how platforms’ information distribution mechanisms affect a society’s ability to aggregate information correctly and efficiently. We consider four criteria that algorithms can favor in curating content: globally most engaging (GE), locally most engaging (LE), globally closest (GC), and/or locally closest (LC). That is, for a given user, platforms can promote beliefs that are most engaging and/or are most similar to her pre-existing belief; beliefs can be sorted globally (among all users) or locally (among the user’s connections). We simulate a social learning model where agents form beliefs by learning from each other and from the information allocated by the platform. We find that while exposing users to engaging beliefs considerably increases learning bias, feeding personalized information based on belief similarity does not affect collective wisdom significantly. All mechanisms except GE slow down the speed for agents to converge to a consensus.",2022,"Chen, Yile"

The present study attempts to understand whether Covid has compounded the disparities in park access and usage based on race and income and whether the disparities varied by the quality of a city’s park system. Using cell phone mobility data, the study compared tract-level park visits in 20 major U.S. cities across racial and income groups before (2019) and during the pandemic (2020). The cities were divided into a high-quality park system group and a low-quality group on the basis of their ParkScore indexes. The results indicated a 6% decline in park visitation during Covid. Regarding park access, the income-based privilege was found in cities with high-quality park systems whereas no racial differences were found regardless in cities with high or low quality of park systems. Only tracts with large Upper-middle-class income families showed increased park usage during the pandemic. Most importantly, the study provides evidence against a positive correlation between physical park accessibility and usability, and it suggests the importance of other factors in promoting park usage.",2022,"Shu, Senling"
macss_66,Applying an Unsupervised Machine Learning Approach to Analyze the Non-Income Poverty Indicators Used in the Listahanan 2,"Poverty targeting has been used in developing countries as a means to provide social protection programs and services directly to the poor. As information on households’ welfare is unavailable or difficult and costly to acquire in the developing world, the proxy means test (PMT), which uses proxy variables to estimate an unobservable welfare variable such as household income or consumption, has become a commonly used method for targeting. This study uses an unsupervised machine learning approach on the set of household- and individual-specific non- income poverty indicators used to estimate household income in the PMT models for the Philippines’ National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction or Listahanan, in order to examine whether differences between households across these indicators reflect differences in their income. Applying the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP) algorithm onto the Listahanan 2 indicators shows that households naturally cluster into three to four groups. However, these clusters seem to be unrelated to income and expenditure. The richest and poorest households appear to be alike and cannot be differentiated on the basis of the non-income poverty indicators considered. This suggests that these indicators alone may not be sufficient for the PMT models to accurately target the poor. However, this study is a preliminary analysis on the limited data available. A more comprehensive analysis is required to produce conclusive results.

macss_67,Patent citation analysis for company valuation in the field of electric vehicles,"The electric vehicle industry is one of the hottest technology sections where patents are essential for companies to survive and compete. The goal of my work is to present EV startups with higher market value locate at more central positions in the patent citation network and to prove forward patent citation has statistical significance to EV startups’ market value, but backward patent citation does not. This study is conducted in four steps: data collection and process, network visualization, network description, and quadratic assignment procedures (QAP). Because this study contributes to practical use in the business field, to ease the use by investors from any backgrounds and industries, I chose social network analysis software NodeXL, which is an easy-to-use and widely adopted add-in to Microsoft Excel. The network visualization presents that, the top two most valued U.S.-based EV startups, Tesla and Atieva, stay at the most pivotal position in the patent citation network. QAP shows strong evidence to support that the number of forward citations positively relates to EV startups’ market value but does not exhibit evidence to prove the statistical significance of backward citation. The results of my study are expected to shed some insights for investors to find investment targets.

Using meteorological data, I reconstruct the extreme exposure of tropical cyclones for each province in the Philippines during 2001-2021. I exploit random within-province year-to-year variation in cyclone strikes with a dynamic two-way fixed effect panel model to identify the causal effect of environmental disasters on local fiscal dynamics. Also, this paper examines different post-disaster fiscal responses for governments of different levels. The major findings are: (1) wind exposure generally induces a drop in government spending (for all levels of governments) and an increase in deficit (for the provincial-level), despite showing some nonlinearity under extremely high wind velocity. (2) There is a persistent significant negative impact of storm exposure on tax revenue, with lower level governments may suffer more. (3) An increase in storm exposure reduces the provincial-level investment activities.

macss_71,Exploring Personality and Online Social Engagement: An Investigation of MBTI Users on Twitter,"Text-based personality analysis by computational models is an emerging field with the potential to significantly improve on key weaknesses of survey-based personality assessment. We1 investigate 3848 profiles from Twitter with self-labeled Myers-Briggs personality types (MBTI) – a framework closely related to the Five Factor Model of personality – to better understand how text-based digital traces from social media can be used to predict user personality traits and explore relationships between community discourse and personality traits. We leverage machine learning and network analysis approaches to analyze relationships between behavioral traits and various facets of engagement on social media. We find that both social engagement metadata and multiple modalities of text from social profiles significantly correlate with factors of the MBTI system – especially the Intuitive/Sensing trait that corresponds to the dimension of Openness in the Five Factor model of personality (the Big 5). We discuss our findings and their implications for the validity of the MBTI and the lexical hypothesis, a foundational theory underlying the Five Factor Model of personality that links language use and behavior. Our results hold optimistic implications for personality psychologists, computational linguists, and other social scientists seeking to clarify the role of behavioral dimensions underlying semi-structured text-based social engagement and illuminate the links between sociolinguistics and core dispositional traits.",2022,"Kadambi, Partha"

macss_75,China’s Film Industry Policies and Implications,"The study discusses China’s film industry and related policies. First, I discuss China’s film industry’s rapid development and the policies that contribute to its growth. I also attempt to depict how the quality of China’s domestic films changes over different periods. I group different policies that have similar effects together. However, I could not apply the difference-in-difference model to quantify and disentangle the impact of each policy. However, using regression models, I assessed the effects of China’s film censorship and found that the censorship has little effect on film revenue and may even increase the viewers’ perception of the film produced. However, this is not to say that censorships are a beneficial policy. As discussed, China’s film censorship is mainly a political tool to control the cultural output and has been essential for the Party-state's ideology and has little economic intention. The censorship limited the creativity of the film producers, and films deemed too “political” would never survive the censorship. Overall, the results indicate that the censorship limited the theme of Chinese-produced films, leaving the user’s perception and the revenue of the screened film intact. Over time, Filmmakers have developed ways to pass the censorship by painting a positive picture of the government in the films. Topic-modelling of the reviews from IMDB also found that reviews for China’s films hardly discuss the effect of censorship. Overall, the study found that censorship’s impact on the economic returns and viewers’ perception of screened films in China is negligible, which may give existing filmmakers little incentive to fight against censorship.",2022,"Shan, Lingfeng"

macss_77,Peer Firms' Earnings Disclosure and Corporate Risk-taking,"Besides firms’ own ones, peer firms' financial disclosures may also affect corporate decision-making. While most existing studies examine how peers’ disclosures influence firms’ investment levels, firms’ risk-taking, which closely correlates to economic stability, remains under-explored. I hypothesize that firms learn important information from their peers’ disclosures, based on which they adjust their risk-taking behaviors. I provide large sample evidence (127,896 firm-year observations) corroborating a negative correlation between peer firms' earnings performance and the focal firm's level of risk-taking. This suggests that when peers disclose outstanding earnings, firms’ fear of competition outweighs their positive expectations of the industry outlook, thus firms tend to be more risk-averse. I also find that compared with over-performing firms, under-performing ones are more risk-loving, which accords with the prospect theory. Finally, I show that under-performing firms are less responsive to peers' earnings in terms of risk propensity because they are always more risk-seeking regardless of the degree of competition.",2022,"Fu, Qishen"

macss_79,Temporal Changes in Individualism and Collectivism in Modern China: Evidence from Google N-gram Viewer and Sina Weibo,"Over the past two decades, China has experienced rapid economic and social development, accompanied by significant cultural changes. Mixed findings have been found in previous studies on changes in individualism and collectivism in China. We propose that discrepancies regarding collectivism change can be explained by collectivism components changing in different directions, driven by modernization. To further explore this issue, we examined cultural changes in the Google Corpus of Chinese books (1990-2018) and Sina Weibo (2011-2020) using word frequency analysis. Shared conclusions in both datasets are that first-person singular pronouns reflecting self-attentional focus increased over time, while first-person plural pronouns reflecting concern for others decreased, and the division of collectivism components in changing directions and relationships with modernization. In other aspects, the two datasets reflected cultural change differently. Google Books results showed a stronger focus on family and in-group relations, reflecting the heritage of traditional Chinese culture that was not related to modernization. As a better representation of public expressions, the results of Sina Weibo were more consistent with our expectations, showing a rising trend in institutional collectivism accompanied by higher education levels and universalism. This study highlights the need for future research that considers collectivism a multidimensional variable and uses multiple research methods to explore possible causes and effects of cultural changes.",2022,"Li, Yutong"
macss_80,Investigating long term pattern of technology innovation and gender imbalance in filmmaking occupations,"Gender gap continues to be a persistent issue in many industries. As many idiosyncratic and institutional factors are discussed, the study in examining female representation and technology innovation is limited. The movie industry, witnessing a digital transformation during the 1980s, is suitable for analyzing the relationship between work-related technology advancement and occupational gender segregation. To find out whether a relationship exists, this research leverages observational data from over 20,000 movies to measure the historical pattern of camera types and the percentage trend of female workers in a position related to camera operation in the U.S. filming industry over the past 100 years. Due to the special setting of the movie industry, where directors can choose to use traditional or innovative technology, this research also sheds light on the gendered difference of technology adoption. This research uses counting approaches, automated text analysis, and regression models to answer two questions: 1) whether traditional technology deters female in career-entry decision-making, and some technology innovation could bridge the gap; 2) As people entering a career, whether a gender disparity exists in adopting and using new technologies. Result presents a strong and robust association of female representation and digital advancement, but the gender difference in adopting new digital technologies after entering the career is not salient.",2022,"Zhou, Sirui"
macss_81,Loneliness and Delay of Gratification: Understanding Childhood Instability,"Chronic stress in early childhood can have negative implications for future life outcomes. This thesis analyzes the relationships between chronic loneliness, perceptions of crime, childhood instability, and classroom behaviors in children. To answer this research question, web scraping was used on Twitter to collect tweets related to the perception of crime in Elkhart, Indiana between June 2016 and May 2019. Topic modeling was conducted on the Twitter data to explore the evolution of topics over time. Crime offense data was collected from an FBI database to analyze actual crime rates in 2016 and 2018. A dataset from the CAPS educational program in Elkhart, Indiana was used to analyze relationships between chronic loneliness, delay of gratification, childhood instability, and other early childhood factors. Logistic and linear regression was conducted on the CAPS data to analyze relationships between the variables. The results indicate that: (i) the perception of crime in the community does not align with actual crime rates, and (ii) no significant relationship exists between childhood instability factors and self-regulation skills in children within the study. This thesis emphasizes the need for policy interventions in early childhood to alleviate chronic stressors that arise from internal and external instability factors in a child’s life. In turn, these interventions will allow for the improvement of future life outcomes in children with social instability.",2022,"Bosko, Angelica"
macss_82,Does China’s Levy Standard Reform Promote SO2 Reduction?,"Using the quasi-natural experiment that adjusts the levy standards of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in different Chinese provinces between 2007 and 2013, this paper examines the effect that such levy standard change exerts on pollution control by adopting the difference in differences (DID) model. Although the effect of the pollution charging policy in China is a widely debated issue due to the low per-unit charge and an “endogenous enforcement of the law”, this paper finds that the increase in pollution charges significantly reduced firms’ SO2 emissions by 27%. This finding remains robust after evaluation with the parallel trend test, placebo tests and other robustness check methods. Compared with state-owned enterprises (SOEs), non-state-owned enterprises are more likely to be driven by policies. In discovering influence mechanism, this paper finds that the increase of levy standard urged firms to cut back consumption of raw coal, fuel coal and heavy oil, while the consumption of clean gas has no significant increase. Only SOEs purchased and upgraded their desulfurization equipment after the reform. This paper also furthers discussion on the externality of the reform. This paper finds no evidence for pollution transferring, but confirms the reduction effect on air SO2 concentration from the levy standard reform.",2022,"Chen, Yuxuan"
macss_83,Embedding GitHub Repositories:  A Comparative Study of the Python and Java Communities,"GitHub, the largest platform for open-source software, which allows code contributors to collaboratively develop software in a variety of programming languages, has motivated extensive research on social coding. However, the heterogeneity of GitHub communities in different programming languages has not been explored in previous studies. Inspired by the linguistic relativity hypothesis, I deduce that different programming languages might result in distinct patterns in social coding. This research identifies such discrepancies between the Python and Java communities based on repository representations (embeddings) from a unique, newly constructed dataset. By describing the representation learning process as a pipeline, this thesis first demonstrates how to generate high-quality repository embeddings from content and contextual data, including source code (import), readme text, and co-contributor networks. The evaluation results suggest that models derived from Word2Vec, including Doc2Vec, Import2Vec, and Node2Vec, are the most competitive for representing the GitHub data. I then used the best performing embeddings to explore language-specific patterns via questions regarding GitHub activities and success. By investigating the consistency between different embedding spaces, I identified how social (contributor) and functional (import, readme) embedding spaces diverge in the Python community but align in the Java community, implying the difference in their socio-functional mapping. Furthermore, the results indicate that functionally similar Python repositories experience more competition and that Python programmers contribute more to functionally diverse repositories when compared with their Java counterparts. Afterward, by analyzing the correlations between the functional diversity and the average popularity among contributed repositories, I found evidence that Python programmers who commit to dissimilar repositories are more likely to be the contributors of popular repositories, while Java programmers do not exhibit this pattern. Finally, by comparing embeddings with baseline features, I verified their potency to predict repository popularity and discovered that functional embeddings are beneficial for predicting Python repositories, while social embeddings contribute more to Java repositories.  These language-related heterogeneities can be attributed to the inherent difference in philosophy between Python and Java: As a language highlighting flexibility and reusability, Python treasures contributors’ ability to produce code for other coders with various functional needs, whereas Java focuses on the independence and thoroughness in programming, prioritizing specialized coding for passive end-users who value only the performance of final products.",2021,Chen Yutao
macss_84,Time preference and Willingness to Consume,"Time preference is an important part of consumer decision patterns for different degrees of discounting indicates different weights placed on intertemporal values. We try to investigate whether economic confidence measuring expected future income and consumers’ current economic assets can affect their willingness to consume and what role time preference plays in the relationships. We surveyed 6,113 adults in the U.S. to collect related variables and fit the data into both linear regression models for estimating continuous changes and a logistic regression model for examining the categorical prediction power given our predictors and adding to the robustness. The results show that there are two channels for time preference to impact willingness to consume: one way is to moderate the relationships with future-oriented economic confidence and current assets; the other way is to directly affect people’s purchasing objectives, to make them put more weight on the things that need to buy now. Through these two channels, the increase of time preference is associated with more orientation to the future consumption and the decrease of it relates to the focus on the present, which is demonstrated as showing greater willingness to consume.",2022,Yanjie Zhou

macss_86,Gentrification Prediction with Modern Techniques,"Gentrification has become a critical issue in urban planning during the past half century. Ruth Glass first coined the term ‘gentrification’ in 1964 to describe the phenomenon that wealthier class replace lower-class in certain neighborhoods in cities. Often gentrification is portrayed as a tool of revitalization for those declining urban areas. It was not until 1979 when the negative consequences of gentrification, known as displacement, was fully understood. The negative socio-economic consequences of displacement including income inequalities and injustices were further investigated and evaluated in modern literature. Governments and non-profit organizations have taken efforts to actively intervene when displacement occurs through various policy responses including job training, apprenticeships, subsidized and transitional employment programs, equal opportunity laws, community reinvestment strategies and more. Besides all the efforts taken by the government after gentrification is detected, successful prediction of gentrification can help identify displacement at an early time and guide policy interventions before they become more costly and less effective. Traditional statistical methods have been applied to forecast gentrification when the negative outputs of gentrification were first noticed and came to social scientists’ attention. In 1980s and 1990s, integrating data from various sources, neighborhood early warning systems were established in big cities, including Chicago Neighborhood Early Warning System, Neighborhood Knowledge Los Angeles, the Philadelphia Neighborhood Information System and so on. Modeling methods take advantage of these systems to provide predictive analysis mainly for municipal agencies. For instance, logistic regression is used to “analyze data from the Philadelphia Neighborhood Information System in order to determine which properties were most likely to become imminently dangerous”. Multivariate regression is also a simple while commonly used method to identify key factors that make a neighborhood to gentrify. These traditional techniques often perform poorly as common measurements of gentrification such as property value cannot be modeled linearly with other features using traditional methods. Some models also fail due to high correlations among variables or autocorrelations in residuals. Therefore, it is necessary to explore innovative predicting algorithms and evaluate their performances. Some studies have sought to employ new algorithms and have found out that techniques like machine learning usually outperform those traditional ones. This project explores how well a range of machine learning models perform on predicting neighborhood gentrification with socio-economic data rather than applying traditional statistical models.",2021,"Gong, Yuqian"

I use the Rig Veda and the Hesiodic corpus (the Theogony and the Shield of Heracles) as control texts, given that they derive from the same culture but belong to different genres. This investigation will attempt to (a) use quantitative methods to corroborate the longstanding hypothesis of literary and cultural Indo-European lineage, and (b) explore uncharted territory in mining structural similarities within large battle books that are difficult to hand-code. I used noun-adjective pairing frequencies and cosine similarity scores generated through SentenceBERT models to uncover poetic and narrative similarities in battle terminology shared between the texts. My overall findings suggest that patterns in poetic diction relating to battle terminology reveal both a stronger commonality of usage between the Indo-European texts as compared with the Near-Eastern influenced control corpus, and deeper commonalities between the two epics poetic diction concerning these battle terms than they share with other texts from within their separate cultures.",2021,"Kanthan, Sruti"

We rely on newcomers to bring in new perspectives, and to maintain activity level within the community. Yet, the fear among old members that the in uxes of newcomers would disturb the community's norm is also pervasive. This paper exploit a subscription policy on Reddit to study the effect of external user shocks on one of the music sharing groups. Data evidence shows that the number of posts and comments increased, but the proportion of posts removed by moderators also increased. The distribution of music genres shared in the community shifted greatly after the influx of new users. A great number of old members gradually existed the community, but those who remained quickly became accustomized to the new norms. At the end of the story, the community in my case study took the pain to survive the new users shock but they did survive.",2021,"Ge,Nan"
macss_89, Effects of Rent Regulation on Housing Quality: Evidence from Manhattan,"This study examines the effect of rent regulation on housing quality in Manhattan. In particular, this study investigates how a specific law change on rent increases due to home improvements in the Rent Act of 2011 affected the rental housing quality in Manhattan. Through combining multiple sources of data, including complaints received by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) and the Department of Buildings (DOB) and building information scraped from NYC public databases, I construct a novel longitudinal dataset with identifiable information of each building and the number of complaints each building receives as a measure of housing quality. Using a combination of regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences, this study shows that the specific law change in the Rent Act of 2011 has a negative effect on the housing quality of the associated rent-stabilized buildings in Manhattan. While previous literature has not reached an agreement on how rent regulation affects housing maintenance and improvements, this study aims to contribute to this discussion with novel data and analyses.",2021,"Tan, Ruoyun"
macss_90,Higher-Order Innovation and New Venture Success,"Entrepreneurship literature points out that a balance between exploration and exploitation leads to a good innovative performance of start-ups, yet how this balance can be achieved remains unknown. This study argues that the modularity principle, adopted from the complexity perspective, is the key to successful innovative strategies. By applying dynamic word embedding techniques to millions of documents from 119 business newspapers, magazines and patents, we construct a dynamic landscape of business discourse across 45 years. By locating new venture descriptions in this dynamic business landscape, we can observe how business elements are recombined within a given new venture and how innovative it was in its own time and historical context. Two different categories of recombination exist for each company: the first-order recombination that combines technical elements to approximate application elements to form basic functional blocks, and second-order recombination that recombines these blocks to satisfy more complex demands. Based on these measurements, we model the start-ups' birth, growth, and death with event history analysis. Our analysis reveals that radical second-order recombination is key to entrepreneurial success in the U.S.: the first-order process calls for exploitation while the second- order process requires exploration. Both exploitation and exploration matter for the new ventures, yet exploitation and exploration co-exist in innovative strategies through a specific architecture.",2021,"Chen, Ziwen"
macss_91,Ridesharing and Public Transit: How has the Covid-19 pandemic affected the relationship?,"The emergence of ridesharing services has transformed the shape of urban transportation and brought impacts on the traditional public transit system. While many previous studies have shed light on the relationship between the two transportation modes from a qualitative perspective, there has not been enough quantitative evidence to characterize the pattern thus far. The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in late 2019 further raises interests in the role of ridesharing services under the public health crisis. This study extends the model proposed by Kong et al. 2020 to identify the potential substitution or complementary effects between ridesharing and public transit and further enriches the model’s interpretability by integrating a preference-based choice model. With real-world ridesharing data from Didi in Shenzhen, China, this study provides a quantitative measurement of the relationship between ridesharing and public transit. The spatial-temporal heterogeneity underlying the pattern is examined using linear and spatial regression designs. Using the ridesharing data of the pre and post-covid time, this study further investigates the shifts in the relationship and makes inferences about the change of passenger preferences under the Covid-19 outbreak. The results show that 2.20% of ridesharing trips have the potential of substituting for public transits in 2019, which slightly increases to 2.56% under the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. The substitution effect becomes stronger during the morning and evening peak hours when public transit is overcrowded, and the complementarity effect is more evident during the night hours when transit routes are less accessible. The results also suggest that ridesharing exhibits a stronger substitution effect to public transit in the central business districts, which are associated with higher housing prices, higher intensity of POIs, more diversified land use, and better spatial coverage of transit stops, and it complements public transit in the areas that are less developed and underserved by public transits. The Covid-19 situation results in an upward shift in the potential substitution effect during the morning (+4.38%) and evening peaks (+3.08%), holding other factors constant, which indicates that ridesharing provides passengers with a utility premium under the Covid-19 situation by reducing the risk of virus exposure in a crowded transit cabin. The findings enrich the literature by providing quantitative support for the relationship and emphasize the important role of ridesharing services under the Covid-19 pandemic.",2021,"Tian, Luxin"

Understanding How American Families Decide Their Division of Labor in Parental Leave in the Pre-birth Period,"Based on Gary Becker's analytical tools—the family production model and the interdependent preferences—for family economics and the later criticisms regarding Becker's auxiliary assumptions, the study attempted to answer how American people's calculation of perceived benefits and costs could mediate the effects of economic factors and gender ideology regarding their parental leave norms during the pre-birth period. With data collected through an online survey on MTurk, the study revealed that male respondents in the survey included both the economic factors and gender ideology in calculating their expected gain and loss of family well-being in taking care of the children. For female respondents, only the gender ideology entered their functions of perceived utility. Moreover, regarding the choice of exiting work for full-time parenting, there was a partial mediating effect existed between male respondents' perceived benefits and their economic factors. By comparison, both perceived costs and benefits for female participants partially mediated the effect of gender ideology.  ",2021,"Deng, Yehong"
macss_93,Weighted Sum Duration: A Point-of-Interest Based Approach for Fixation Duration Analysis in Eye-tracking Data,"Many eye-tracking data analyses rely on the Area-of-Interest (AOI) methodology, which utilizes AOIs to analyze metrics such as fixations. However, AOI-based methods have some inherent limitations, including variability and subjectivity in the shape, size, and location of AOIs. This thesis proposes an alternative approach to the traditional AOI dwell time analysis: Weighted Sum Durations (WSD). This approach decreases the subjectivity of AOI definitions by using Points-of-Interest (POI) while maintaining interpretability. In WSD, the durations of fixations toward each POI are weighted by the distance from the POI and summed together to generate a metric comparable to AOI dwell time. To validate WSD, I reanalyzed data from a previously published eye-tracking study (N = 90). The re-analysis replicated the original findings that people gaze less towards faces and more toward points of contact when viewing violent social interactions.",2021,"Rim, Nak Won"
macss_94,Impact of Cares Act Stimulus on Consumption: Evidence from Zip Code Level Transactions,"We study the causal effect of the CARES Act on consumer expenditure during the Covid-19 pandemic with the Facteus data set. We use the transaction data at the Zip code level of over twelve million bank cards in eighteen central states to estimate the treatment effect of the stimulus. This question is identified because of the geographic and temporal variation in receiving the deposit across Zip codes. Our empirical findings suggest that in the first weekend receiving the stimulus, the overall spending increase by 53%. In particular, the expenditure on essential and financial categories increases by 62% and 76%. Unlike the tax rebates in 2001 and economic stimulus payments in 2008, people spend most of the payments on non-durable goods and services such as grocery, utility, money order, Etc. The estimated effect is substantial for districts with lower education, lower white ratio, and higher poverty, where poverty generates the most striking heterogeneity.",2021,"Yuan, Zhen"
macss_95,How Does Superhost Accreditation Benefit Airbnb Hosts in the City of Chicago?,"In order to obtain a superhost accreditation, an Airbnb host has to meet a series of strict requirements, including a 90% response rate, 80% 5-star reviews, honor confirmed reservations, etc. However, is it worth the effort to get such an accreditation? How does the superhost status benefit the hosts? Based on signaling theory that effective information disclosure in markets can help provide positive encouragement and maintain benign market conditions, we assume that superhost status serves as a positive market signal, and thus can benefit the badge owner in some way. Choosing Chicago as our target city, where Airbnb hosts have earned tens of millions of dollars over the 5 biggest weekends in 2019, we take advantage of content analysis techniques, decision tree, random forest models, ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression and further multilevel modeling to answer the question. Our findings confirm that superhosts do have significantly higher income in comparison with normal hosts. Nevertheless, such accreditation does not tend to bring up their rental price. One critical channel through which superhosts earn more consists in their capacity to maintain a relatively higher occupancy rate, which is achieved mainly through providing better accommodation services. Furthermore, even though Chicago has a notorious reputation for high crime rate and conspicuous residential segregation, neither the safety nor race issues reduce host revenues.",2021,Yongfei Lu
macss_96,Where do new ideas come from: New directions in science emerge from disconnection and discord,"Since the 1950s, citation number or “impact” has been the dominant metric by which science is quantitatively evaluated. But research contributions play distinct roles in the unfolding drama of scientific debate, agreement and advance, which are differentially valued by scientists and their institutions. Computational power, access to citation data and an array of modeling techniques have given rise to a widening portfolio of metrics that extract different signals regarding their contribution to scientific activities. Besides impact, the innovation of work and the way that it builds up the scientific discussions are taken into consideration. Here we unpacks the complex, temporally evolving relationship between citation impact alongside novelty and disruption, two emerging measures that capture the degree to which science not only influences, but transforms later work. Novelty is measured at the point of production and captures how research draws upon unusual combinations of prior work. Disruption is measured over time and captures how research comes to eclipse or amplify the prior work on which it builds. We theorize that novel papers will exhibit disruptive impact over time, and demonstrate how they are much more likely than conventional papers to disrupt current literature. Novel papers do not do so immediately, but often become “sleeping beauties”, accumulating surprising attention and citation impact over the long run. In summary, new directions for science are created from a lack of consensus. Finally, we show how novelty can be reformulated as the combination of ideas across knowledge space to reveal the combinatorial nature of advance. The evolution of knowledge space over time characterizes how yesterday’s novelty forms today’s scientific conventions, which condition the novelty—and surprise—of tomorrow’s breakthroughs.",2021,"Lin, Yiling"
macss_97,Common sense reasoning against algorithmic misinformation using Knowledge Graph Embeddings,"Knowledge Graph Embedding algorithms learn low-dimensional vector representa- tions for facts in a Knowledge Graph (where each fact is a relation edge between head and tail nodes). Learned embeddings are increasingly adapted for down- stream tasks (like question-answering, statement classification, recommendation engines, and even auto-completion of incomplete Knowledge Graphs). In the real world, training datasets of facts (in domains like news events, public records, or user actions) can be inaccurate due to sampling issues, bias, malicious intent, or noise. This makes it important to design for robustness to corrupted data. This paper investigates how two popular Knowledge Graph Embedding algorithms (TransE, DistMult) respond to deliberate corruption of training data, using the Freebase15K-237 dataset. This paper uses a novel true/false triplet classification evaluation to demonstrate the utility of learned embeddings as features for truth prediction, showing surprising robustness to corrupted data. It uses negative sam- pling to operationalize different types of common-sense reasoning in the stages of learning (model training) and testing (model evaluation) - demonstrating the usefulness of naive negative sampling strategies, contrary to prevailing intuitions in the literature. It uses this to frame a social science interpretation for the Knowledge Graph Embedding training process, with implications for designing for robustness against inaccuracies in Knowledge Graph data.",2021,"Abubaker Kar, Aabir"

macss_99,Embracing New Techniques in Deep learning for Predicting the Memorability of Images,"Various work has suggested that the memorability of an image is consistent across people, and thus can be treated as an intrinsic property of an image. Using computer vision models, we can make specific predictions about what people will remember or forget. While older work has used now-outdated deep learning architectures to predict image memorability, innovations in the field have given us new techniques to apply to this problem. Here, we propose and evaluate five alternative deep learning models which exploit developments in the field from the last five years, largely the introduction of residual neural networks, which are intended to allow the model to use semantic information in the memorability estimation process. These new models were tested against the prior state of the art with a combined dataset built to optimize both within-category and across-category predictions. Our findings suggest that the key prior memorability network had overstated its generalizability and was overfit on its training set. Our new models outperform this prior model, leading us to conclude that Residual Networks outperform simpler convolutional neural networks in memorability regression. We make our new state-of-the-art model readily available to the research community, allowing memory researchers to make predictions about memorability on a wider range of images.",2021,"Needell, Coen D."
macss_100,"Mouse trajectories are reflective of who you are: regression analysis of cursor movements, attentiveness, and personality traits.","In this rapidly digitizing world, it is becoming ever more important to understand people’s online behaviors in both commercial and research settings. A cost-effective way to gain a deeper understanding of these behaviors is to examine mouse movement patterns. This research explores the feasibility of inferring personality traits from these patterns. Linear regression, correlation analyses, and PLS regression were performed to examine the relationships between cursor movement features such as pauses, fixations, and cursor speed, and two types of internal characteristics — general attentiveness and personality traits. Significant relationships were found between these features: mouse movement features such as clicks and fixations are significantly correlated with attentiveness, whereas attentiveness is significantly correlated with all five dimensions of the Big Five personality traits. Our results validate the feasibility of using mouse movement data to infer internal traits. These findings have possible applications in two realms: 1) the method presented here can be applied in research to filter inattentive participants, 2) commercial user experience research can apply the same method to gain insights on users’ personality to better cater to their demands .",2021,"Niu, Tianyue"
macss_101,How does  U.S. Quantitative Easing policy affect stock prices in emerging economies? : Evidence from China,"This paper estimates the effect of Quantitative Easing (QE) in the United States on the stock prices in emerging economies. We especially focus on China. The spillover effect of QE shock to stock markets in other emerging economies is also discussed. The estimation is done in two steps. We first select one best measurement of QE policy to be implemented in the subsequent analysis. Then we use the selected QE measurement to fit a structural VAR model to study the response of stock market in China to the QE policy shocks. We estimate the model with both short-run and long-run restrictions under various identification schemes to evaluate sensitivity of our results. Our empirical results show that the QE policy shock significantly increases the stock prices in China in both short and long term. Our analysis provides empirical evidence on the influence and transmission channel of unconventional monetary policies. Based on the result, we suggest that Chinese government should implement proper regulations to the domestic overheating stock market in reaction to the U.S. QE shock. ",2021,"Zhang, Qian"

macss_103,Why are IPOs Always Underpriced? An Empirical Study of Behavioral Economics,"IPO underpricing has become one of the most famous market anomalies in the modern financial market. This phenomenon, called the ""New Issue Puzzle,"" stimulated a hot debate among economists. Many of them focused on explaining the cause of this anomaly using the classical economics models. It is relatively novel to explain this anomaly based on behavioral economics theories. This paper took a comprehensive perspective, considered two possible stages that the underpricing derived from: the pricing stage and the trading stage. For each stage, the paper proposed two hypotheses based on the behavioral economics theory and examined the hypotheses with the OLS regression model and the most up-to-date machine learning techniques (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting). The results demonstrate that the underpricing level of IPO is positively correlated to managerial confidence. This furtherly implies that the underpricing of IPOs is partially derived from the behaviors in the pricing stage. Besides, the result of four classification models validates that investor sentiments would contribute to the underpricing. Using company features and investor sentiments extracted from the online discussion could classify whether the IPO will be underpriced or not at a precision level of about 74%.",2021,Yanwei Pan

macss_105,A Noisy Channel Model of N400 and P600 Effects in Sentence Comprehension,"N400 and P600 event-related potential (ERP) components have long been the object of study in psycholinguistics. Traditional accounts have associated N400 effects with semantic violations, and P600 effects with syntactic violations. However, this picture is complicated by P600 effects—without N400 effects—in response to animacy and thematic- role violations, as well as biphasic N400/P600 effects for conventional semantic violations. Building on explanations involving interplay of plausibility- driven and syntax-driven interpretations, we present a computational model that accounts for these complicating observations via a noisy channel modeling framework. Our model assumes early-stage sentence interpretations determined by noisy channel computation (influenced by plausibility), with these heuristic interpretations driving the N400 amplitude. The P600 then reflects a reconciliation with the true (syntax-driven) interpretation, impacted by the extent to which heuristic interpretations deviate from the true input. Running this model on original experimental stimuli, we successfully simulate N400 and P600 effects reported by eight studies in the literature that we examined. To our knowledge this is the first fully-specified computational formalization of plausibility/syntax interplay, the first implemented noisy channel model to carry out direct prediction of both N400 and P600 components.",2021,"Li, Jiaxuan"

macss_107,Risk Transmission Mechanism across Industries in China,"Learning how the financial risk has been transmitted between industries in China before and after some big events is a crucial topic in risk manage- ment. Due to the large number of industries in China, the market can be regarded as a high-dimension network. To conduct the empirical research on risk transmission mechanism in China based on daily data of the SWS (Shen Wan Security) secondary industry index, I utilize the LASSO algorithm to compress, select and estimate variables and build a high dimensional VAR model and calculate the pairwise risk connectedness between different in- dustries. With the help of network analysis, I visualize the outcome of the VAR-Lasso model. Then, both full sample estimation and rolling window estimation are applied to provide static analysis and dynamic analysis on the risk transmission network. Based on the analysis, clustering character- istics can be easily found in risk transmission of the market, especially be- tween industries in the same industrial chain or between industries that are closely connected. Particularly, Oil exploitation, Insurance, Banking, and Railway Transportation are functioning as an efficient intermediary nodes in the whole transmission process. As for dynamic analysis, the overall risk connectedness reaches the summit during the great stock crisis in 2015 and the shock of COVID-19.

macss_111,Is There a Predictability Hierarchy in Reference Resolution?,"The concept of accessibility has often been evoked to explain reference resolution. According to the Givenness Hierarchy theory, a referent’s accessibility in the mental state of a comprehender is encoded in the form of the referent as part of its lexical semantic representation. However, the current literature has not reached a consensus on what accessibility exactly means and how to best quantify it. The factors that modulate accessibility show a great extent of overlap with another independently motivated concept—predictability—raising the possibility of a “Predictability Hierarchy” that mirrors Givenness Hierarchy. Using a self-paced reading experimental design, the current study examines whether there is such a “Predictability Hierarchy,” by manipulating the predictability and the form of the referent presented to the participants. Our results indicate that although there is no strong evidence for approximating the Givenness Hierarchy with a “Predictability Hierarchy,” there is some preliminary evidence for a partial correlation between the form and the predictability of a referent.",2021,"Xu, Weijie"
macss_112,Identifying the relationship between US monetary policy and the VIX futures: An empirical characterization using VAR methodology,"New Keynesian theory believes the central bank control over the real interest rate both in the short run and the long run due to the price stickiness. The expectation on the rental rate of capital is reflected by the real interest rate. Therefore, the return on the assets, determined by the expected future dividends, can be heavily influenced by the real interest rate. Vector autoregressive model (VAR) has been widely used to address issues regarding both identification and the impact of monetary policy. This paper aims to investigate the interdependence between asset prices and monetary policy in the VAR model, combining both traditional short-run and long-run restrictions. Instead of using stock prices as indicators of monetary policy stance, this paper introduced VIX futures price which may provide additional forecasting information in either the determinants of target variables or the target variables. The principal component analysis is implemented to reduce the dimensions of VIX futures data. According to the outcome, a contractionary monetary policy shock raises the real interest rate and lowers the output. In addition, it also reduces asset prices.

macss_116,Diversity and Cohesion: Exploring Employment as Mediator,"Motivation: As the United States becomes increasingly diverse through immigration, understanding how demographic change affects community solidarity is a critical policy concern. While research documents associations between ethnic diversity and social cohesion, the mechanisms driving these relationships remain unclear. Problem Statement: This study examines whether employment mediates the relationship between immigration-driven demographic change and social cohesion. Specifically, it tests if increases in foreign-born population shares reduce natives’ employment opportunities, thereby lowering social cohesion. Approach: We combine data from the American Community Survey and the CPS-CEV supplement (2017–2023), analyzing 43,548 respondents across 12 metropolitan areas. Linear mediation models decompose total associations into direct and indirect (via employment) effects, with bootstrap confidence intervals and robustness checks (simulation-based GLMs, IPW, regression imputation). Results: Metros with significant foreign-born growth exhibit a binary cohesion effect of β = 0.002 (95% CI: –0.009, 0.012; p=0.917) and a continuous effect of β = 0.032 (95% CI: –0.001, 0.068; p=0.071). Indirect effects via employment are negligible (0.0001; 95% CI: –0.0003, 0.0005), representing <1% mediation. Conclusions: Employment does not meaningfully mediate demographic-change effects on social cohesion, challenging economic-competition explanations. Very small effect sizes suggest minimal practical significance; policies should consider alternative pathways like intergroup contact, cultural-bridge initiatives, or institutional responses.",2025,"Kozlowski, Ethan"
macss_117,Job Diversity and Political Selection in China,"Political elites rarely advance by moving up a single, well defined ladder; instead they accumulate experience across a variety of posts, creating defacto career tracks. Yet we still know surprisingly little about how those tracks pay off and why. We offer a systematic assessment of career pathways in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1982 to 2012. We assemble an annual panel of every full and alternate Central-Committee member, we map unique jobs into a directed transition network, and apply a SpringRank algorithm to derive a continuous leadership–status scale that spans all bureaucratic domains. This study takes a novel perspective on the selection of leaders in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). We measure career tracks of full and alternate CCP Central Committee members investigate their role in political selection. We find that the career tracks corresponding to frequent rotations are associated with significantly higher probabilities of obtaining top leadership positions in the CCP despite the influence of patronage networks. By comparing the role of career tracks with that of personal connections, our findings speak to the research on institutional versus personalistic rules in non-democracies.",2025,"Rondo, Roberto"
macss_118,Explaining Gendered Language Through Embedding Approximation: How “Stupid” Became a Man’s Word,"Recent advances in word embedding and digitized text have reinvigorated macro-historical cultural analysis based on empirical data. However, static word2vec embedding, a distance-based measurement of latent semantic structures, becomes less interpretable when moved beyond survey-validated categories. Often, there is a one-to-many mapping between low-level semantic distance and high-level meanings, obscuring the pragmatic language use that drive latent semantic shifts in the embedding space. Focusing on “unintelligence” words in 20th-century American discourse, I critique the stereotype-based interpretation of their changing gender alignment in historical word2vec embeddings of American literature. While the gender axis reliably measures word associations, low-level associations do not neatly map onto well-defined gender stereotypes. Applying an adapted A La Carte approximation of individual context words and sentences, I suggest another possible interpretation: that the masculinization of “unintelligence” words could have stemmed from the increasing harshness in tone (a spurious variable), not judgments of male intelligence or stupidity. This study highlights the interpretive gap in embedding-based methods and calls for more rigorous approaches to making intersubjectively valid interpretations on cultural change.",2025,"Zhu, Yutong"
macss_119,"Tracing the Evolution of Public and Media Perceptions of LLMs: A Longitudinal Analysis of Sentiment, Topics, and Trends","This thesis conducted a longitudinal analysis examining the evolution of public and media perceptions towards Large Language Models (LLMs) from December 2022 to October 2024. Utilizing more than 300,000 Reddit submissions and approximately 10,000 news articles, it applied sentiment analysis and topic modelling to explore the trends of sentiment and topics in the context of LLMs. Public discussions on Reddit exhibited gradual increases and fluctuations tied to the releases of new models and contained a wide range of sentiments, such as approval, gratitude, disappointment, and annoyance. The amount of public discussions on Reddit steadily increased over time, with noticeable spikes in activity following the release of major LLMs. The dominant sentiment also varied across topics, for instance, computer science-related discussions showed relatively higher proportions of positive attitudes toward LLMs compared to other themes such as health or education. In contrast, media coverage sharply increased after significant events and maintained a neutral emotion in general. Topic analyses highlighted common discussion areas between the public and media, such as healthcare, education, and career. However, the public emphasized technical details and daily-life applications, whereas media reports centred around corporate events, ethical concerns, and broader societal implications.",2025,"Ertong, Wei"
macss_120,Topic Modeling and Analysis of Misinformation in India,"The rapid proliferation of misinformation in the digital age poses significant challenges to democratic processes, particularly in multilingual and multicultural societies like India. This thesis investigates the thematic structure, temporal patterns, and user engagement dynamics of misinformation during two general election cycles (2019 and 2024) and major socio-political events. By leveraging computational methods such as BERTopic for topic  modeling and sentiment analysis using large language models (LLMs), this research analyzes data from BoomLive, a fact-checking organization, and Twitter activity from Mohammed Zubair, co-founder of Alt News. The findings reveal distinct patterns in misinformation spread, with peaks aligning closely with electoral milestones and thematic shifts reflecting political and communal nar ratives. Health-related misinformation dominated during the COVID-19 pandemic, while communal and political falsehoods surged during elections. User engagement varied across themes, with politically charged misinformation eliciting polarized reactions and communal narratives driving higher engagement metrics. Sentiment analysis highlighted users’ tendency to engage selectively with fact-checks that aligned with their ideological beliefs, underscoring the role of motivated reasoning in shaping public discourse.",2025,"Gajbhiye, Pritam Rashtrapal"

This study compares the predictive power of two types of UGS measurements — park proximity and NDVI — in the machine learning models to predict housing prices in Chicago. By incorporating real estate big data, GIS analysis, and Machine Learning techniques, the result indicates NDVI is a strong predictor for single-family residential properties on the fringe of the urban core.",2025,"Sheng, Kuang"
macss_122,From Binary to Multiplicity: Rethinking Women’s Portrayals in Chinese State-owned Media,"This study investigates the evolving portrayals of women in Chinese state-owned media through a computational analysis of the People’s Daily corpus from 1940s to 2000s. Chal- lenging traditional binary frameworks that simplify portrayals into either masculinized or feminized images, this research applies computational social science methods such as node embedding and topic modeling to identify the dynamic shifts in the oﬀicial gender discourse system. The empirical findings reveal that, rather than shifting between two idealized states, women’s representations strategically adapted to the state’s changing ideological and political objectives. Three distinct historical periods are identified: the early Mao’s era characterized by rather diverse representations aligning with revolutionary mobiliza- tion; the Cultural Revolution marked by singular, intensified political portrayals; and the post-reform era that witnessed a revival of traditional familial roles along with new represen- tations emphasizing individual economic success and national pride in sports. By reframing women’s portrayals through the lens of gender fluidity and performativity, this research challenges oversimplified masculinization narratives about the Mao’s era and provides new insights into how state power strategically adapt its construction of gender norms.",2025,"Cao, Jie"
macss_123,"Traffic and the Racialized Built Environment: Applying a New Lens on HOLC ""Redlining"" Maps to Understand Traffic Safety Outcomes","Traffic fatalities are understood to be a pressing cause of fatality in the United States, but the fundamental causes of inequities in their distribution are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to understand the influences of one such fundamental cause: the implemen- tation of antiquated neighborhood lifecycle theories through racially discriminatory policies. Through a propensity matching design within five American cities, we found evidence that traffic health disparities are tied to the perceptions of race and space held by governmental entities such as the HOLC, but are not necessarily tied to redlining or other policies derived from neighborhood lifecycle theories. Our discovered relationships also vary by city, leading to potential implications for future studies using HOLC maps to understand modern health inequities.",2025,"Wimer, Ashlynn"
macss_124,Spatial Spillovers and Technical Efficiency in U.S. Local Banks,"This study examines whether technical efficiency in U.S. community banks is shaped by spatial spillovers and how these effects are conditioned by financial and institutional factors. Employing a two-stage empirical strategy, we first estimate bank-level efficiency scores using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), followed by bias-corrected truncated regressions within a spatial Simar and Wilson (2007) framework. As a robustness check, we replicate the main findings using a spatial Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) approach. The analysis draws on panel data from 4,936 community banks spanning 2015–2019. The results provide robust evidence of spatial interdependence: banks’ efficiency levels are significantly influenced by the characteristics of neighboring institutions, particularly in terms of capital structure, income diversification, and liquidity positions. Two primary mechanisms underpin these spillovers. First, relationship lending promotes the diffusion of soft information, amplifying local interbank linkages through social and informational embeddedness. Second, the magnitude and direction of spatial effects are heterogeneous, varying systematically with institutional contexts, especially across Federal Reserve Dis- tricts and data-driven spatial regimes. The overlap between regulatory jurisdictions and identified spatial clusters points to the relevance of localized supervision in shaping efficiency dynamics. By integrating spatial heterogeneity into the analysis of bank performance, the findings underscore the impor- tance of accounting for geographic structure in both academic modeling and policy design concerning community banking.",2025,"Li, Zhuyin"
macss_125,Cultural Legacies of Agriculture: The Impact of Rice Farming on Innovation Success in China,"This paper examines how historical rice-farming traditions shape modern innovation outcomes in China. Using county-level data and a spatial regression discontinuity design centered on the Qinling–Huaihe Line—the geographic boundary separating traditional rice and wheat farming regions—we investigate whether deep-rooted cultural legacies constrain the quality of innovation, as measured by invention patent success rates. The results show that regions with a rice-farming legacy exhibit significantly lower innovation success, despite no observable effect on the number of enterprises. This pattern suggests that collectivist cultural traits, shaped by historical agricultural systems, continue to suppress risk-taking and originality, which are essential for high-quality innovation, even within modern institutional environments. Our findings contribute to the literature on cultural economics by demonstrating that the impact of historical norms varies across types of economic activity. While modern institutions may support general entrepreneurship, they appear insufficient to overcome deeper cultural constraints on innovation effectiveness. These insights highlight the need for targeted strategies, such as incentive structures and cultural interventions, to foster breakthrough innovation in culturally risk-averse contexts.",2025,"Zhou, Charlotte"
macss_126,"Perceived Usefulness of eWOM in Movie Reviews: A Multi-Level Analysis of Content Features, User Traits, and Interactive Dynamics","Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) significantly influences consumer decision-making because prospective viewers rely on peers’ first-hand opinions to reduce uncertainty and anticipate their own enjoyment—an effect that is especially pronounced for narrative prod- ucts such as movies. This influence is amplified by Web 2.0 technologies, which make peer reviews highly searchable at critical decision points, and by the credibility conferred through identity-based social networks. However, despite this growing social reliance, most existing studies overlook the broader context in which reviews circulate, implicitly treating each review as an independent unit. This study investigates how content features, reviewer characteristics, social network position, spoiler labels, and herd behavior collectively shape the perceived usefulness of movie eWOM on Douban Movies. By analyzing data from 185,516 movie reviews and their associated user networks using zero-inflated negative bi- nomial regression models, this research demonstrates that content richness and reviewer credibility substantially increase perceived usefulness. Reviews containing spoilers receive higher usefulness evaluations, suggesting spoilers reduce consumer uncertainty. Notably, re- viewers occupying bridging positions (high betweenness centrality) exert greater influence, aligning with social capital theory. In contrast, content similarity driven by herd behavior negatively affects usefulness perceptions, indicating redundancy diminishes perceived infor- mational value. This research extends the eWOM literature by integrating content-level and individual-level characteristics with interaction dynamics, offering practical implications for managing online review platforms and narrative product marketing strategies.",2025,"Li, Zhuoqing"
macss_127,Thematic Analysis on Intersectional Harassment in Online Misogyny,"As feminist activism gains visibility online, women increasingly face gender-based abuse in digital spaces, much of it originating from the ”manosphere”—a constellation of anti- feminist online communities such as incels. While prior research has examined the preva- lence of misogyny in online communities, less attention has been paid to how misogynist disproportionately targets women along intersecting social identities, including race, class, sexuality, etc. Intersectionality describes how overlapping systems of oppression interact to shape the lived experiences of people (Crenshaw, 1991). Specifically, the current study focuses on intersectional misogyny, defined as misogyny that invokes harassment related to one’s race, ability, class, or other identities. This study contributes to current literature in this area through two research questions: (1) How effectively can fine-tuned language models be used to detect intersectional harassment in misogynistic online forums? and (2) How do categories of misogynistic expression cluster within manosphere discourse, and in what ways do these clusters coalesce around particular intersectional identity markers? To answer these questions, I draw on a dataset of over 716k posts from one of the most active and unmoderated platforms in the manosphere: incel.is forum, focusing on those matched to physical and sexual violence lexicons. I manually annotated 7,000 posts based on whether it contains the presence intersectional targeting hostile language. For RQ1, a supervised HateBERT model was fine-tuned to detect intersectional harassment within the corpus. For RQ 2, an unsupervised topic modeling pipeline using BERTopic was used to inductively extract thematic clusters from the entire corpus. Next, the supervised HateBERT classifier was overlaid on these four macro thematic clusters to compute the proportion of posts containing intersectional harassment. This two-step pipeline enable to identify intersectionally harmful post and to analyze how such intersectional harassment cluster within manosphere contexts. The best-performing classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.73, with significant recall im- provements through class weighting, highlighting the potential of NLP models to detect nuanced intersectional hate speech. Regarding RQ2, results show that intersectional ha- rassment is not evenly distributed across four emerging macro themes, including Violence Fantasy, Fatalistic Worldview, Body-Based Devaluation, and Socioeconomic Complaint. Limitations of the study lie in the scope of human annotation and classifier’s deficit ability of detecting implicit harassment that lack overt identity markers. Future research should develop benchmark datasets for implicit intersectionality and expand annotation frame- works to include a broader range of misogynistic expressions. These steps would allow for more robust models capable of uncovering how intersectional hostility evolves across digital subcultures over time.",2025,"Zhong, Haoyu"
macss_128,Geopolitical Tensions and the Energy Stock Market: Examining Oil Price Volatility and U.S. Energy Stock Responses,"This study examines how crude oil price volatility affects the price returns of leading energy companies in the U.S. stock market during two major geopolitical events: the 2014–2017 OPEC–Russia oil price war and the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war. Using the Bai-Perron structural break test, the study identifies critical turning points in oil price dynamics, fol- lowed by ARMA-EGARCH modeling to analyze volatility patterns during periods of crisis. The study finds strong asymmetries in oil price volatility, with negative shocks amplifying market uncertainty, particularly during crisis peaks. Furthermore, this study estimates a vector autoregressive (VAR) model to identify the relationship between oil price shocks and firm-level stock returns across upstream, integrated, and downstream oil and gas companies. The findings show that upstream firms exhibit stronger and more persistent reactions to oil price shocks, while integrated and downstream firms display quicker but more transient responses, returning to baseline levels in a shorter time frame. Notably, the Russia–Ukraine war triggered more synchronized and significant stock price reactions across firms, but these effects were shorter-lived compared to the earlier oil price war. These insights deepen our understanding of the oil-stock nexus and the behavior of stock prices in periods of height- ened geopolitical risks.",2025,"Luo, Yuqing (Alice)"
macss_129,"Converging Discourse, Diverging Audiences: Authoritarian Propaganda with Strategic Differentiation","This thesis introduces the concept of \textit{strategic differentiation} to explain how authoritarian regimes, rather than issuing uniform propaganda, adapt their messaging across platforms and audiences in a deliberate, calibrated manner. Drawing on Chinese state media texts from 2007 to 2022—including China Central Television (CCTV), People’s Daily, and Government Work Reports—this study examines how language, framing, and interpretive accessibility vary depending on audience sophistication and political context. Using semantic network analysis with FastText word embeddings and entropy-based readability metrics, the study finds systematic evidence of discursive segmentation. Elite-facing platforms employ lexically rich, technical language, while mass-facing outlets rely on simplified, emotionally resonant narratives. Temporal analysis reveals that propaganda coherence intensifies during crises and relaxes during routine periods, suggesting that message alignment is a strategic choice rather than a constant feature. These findings contribute to the literature on authoritarian information control by highlighting how regimes manage interpretation—not only through content, but through audience-specific messaging strategies. While the study is limited in its focus on textual media and does not directly measure audience reception, it provides a structured framework and replicable method for analyzing differentiated propaganda. The concept of strategic differentiation offers a new lens for understanding how authoritarian regimes communicate selectively to maintain control, manage legitimacy, and contain dissent.",2025,"Jiang, Duoji"
macss_130,Instagram Shadowbans: Testing for Algorithmic Changes in Treatment of 'Political' Content,"Social media platforms have turned to AI content moderation in response to increased scrutiny for the kind of content they circulate, especially due to major potential for social and political influence. Algorithmic reduction,  colloquially known as ‘shadowbans,’ are favorable for platforms due to their opaqueness, which allows for evasion of responsibility and creates a Foucauldian relationship of platform power and creator discipline. As such, platforms intentionally manufacture opacity surrounding algorithmic reduction. Instagram in particular has recently announced changes in algorithmic content that has caused outrage about their approach to free expression, in part due to vague definitions. This work seeks to shed light on Instagram’s intentionally opaque policies. To do so, I define a ‘model drift’ test to measure change in the ability of a neural network model to predict post like counts. I compare model drift to drift in data in order to tease out algorithmic drift from behavioral drift. I find confirmation that the February 2024 policy change did likely result in algorithmic reduction of content from politicians. More interestingly, I find that pro-Palestine and Zionist content have similar rates of engagement, but only pro-Palestine content shows signs of algorithmic reduction, starting as soon as one week after October 7, 2023. This research serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that intentionally opaque algorithmic reduction can still be investigated. Future research to bring transparency to social media practices is essential for understanding otherwise opaque and guarded practices of algorithmic moderation.",2025,"Shao, Grace"
macss_131,Tracing the Social Construction of Abortion Attitudes in Online Discourse,"Building on research that highlights how elite actors have progressively constructed abortion as a polarized moral issue (Cassese et al., 2025; Ziegler, 2020), this study examines abortion attitudes through the lens of a social constructionist theory (Berger and Luckmann, 1966). It analyzes how polarization and social construction surrounding abortion materialize within bottom-up digital dis- course, and it evaluates the effectiveness of computational methods in capturing these patterns. While previous work has examined the presence of factors like elite polarization and social construc- tion on abortion attitudes, fewer have investigated how these dynamics manifest in digital spaces. This work offers insight into the digital reproduction of ideological structures and the potential and limitations of computational approaches for studying social construction processes. Using a dataset of Reddit comments comprising 2.5 million comments, later refined to a subset of 27,451, this study applies dictionary-based keyword classification and Support Vector Classifi- cation to classify the comments into abortion attitudinal stances (‘Pro-Choice’, ‘Pro-Life’ and ‘No Stance/Neutral’) followed by topic modeling (BERTTopic) to analyze large-scale digital text. Results show that, when informed by domain knowledge and iterative qualitative refinements, computational models can assist in identifying theoretical constructs such as polarization and so- cial meaning-making within digital discourse. Additionally, findings show that Pro-Life discourse has a more rigid, elite-driven structure, evidenced through the tight semantic structure and dis- proportionate topic distribution, with many of the dominant themes closely identifying with elite narratives outlined in previous research. Conversely, Pro-Choice discourse is much more decentral- ized, suggesting that the Pro-Life ideology has been carefully socially constructed over the past century.",2025,"Griffin, Emma"
macss_132,From Tool to Companion: An Unsupervised Typology of Human-LLM Interaction,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly adapted from specialized tools to everyday conversational partners. Rather than following the technical tradition of asking what LLMs can do, this study explores empirically how people actively frame their encounters with them. I drew 440k English-language first-turn prompts from the open-access WildChat corpus on human-ChatGPT interaction, embedded each into a 384-dimensional semantic space  (MiniLM-L6-v2), clustered the landscape with unsupervised learning techniques, and interpreted 60 different topic clusters through qualitative close-reading. The process visually typologized the prompts into a “graded spectrum” — instead of categorizing discrete “use cases,” I depicted an interpretable continuum from highly instrumental queries to deeply expressive or esoteric engagements. Another critical methodological finding is that apparent topical “coherence” often reflects authorship concentration rather than genuine consensus — a small cadre of “power-users” contributed thematically narrow yet voluminous exchanges, inflating the semantic density in repeated or industrialized use. This outsized footprint can skew the usage patterns in open-source chatlogs datasets, leading analysts to underestimate the genuine breadth and interweaving of topics while overestimating the prevalence of anthropomorphism and niche role-playing. The findings complicate the simplistic scope that juxtaposes utilitarian and anthropomorphic use of AI. I showed that many users approach ChatGPT not as a neutral tool but as a mutable social actor, strategically anthropomorphized inside local narrative frames. There is a shifting ecology of motives that is prominent in the dataset yet less discussed in existing studies — from affective self-therapy to workplace automation, and with the hidden labour (“playbor”) of heavy users who are quietly shaping public training data and, by extension, future model behavior. The findings foreground the social and emotional stakes of LLM use, and invite designers to treat usage data with caution while honoring the plurality of ways that humans want to converse with — rather than merely through — their machines.",2025,"Zhu, Tianfang"

macss_134,Uncovering Market Trends Through Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis of Annual Reports,"This paper investigates the use of sentiment analysis and topic modeling to uncover hidden themes and sentiments in annual reports of publicly traded companies, offering a novel way to assess market trends that may not be immediately visible through traditional analysis. Sentiment analysis using BERT tracks sentiment trends across industries and the broader market over time, focusing on reports from companies of Dow Jones Index and top firms in semiconductors, IT, and energy industries. Topic modeling using LDA identifies evolving topics in reports from the leading companies in each industry. These findings are then compared with stock price movements to assess their predictive power. The results indicate a R-squared correlation of around 0.5 between the sentiment and stock performance in the semiconductor and information technology sectors,  while the energy sector shows a R-squared correlation of around 0.1. Topic modeling effectively captures industry-specific developments and legal challenges, though it overlooks significant events at times. This study demonstrates the potential of NLP to enhance the analysis of qualitative data in annual reports, offering researchers and analysts a new method to assess company performance and market trends.",2024,"Lu, Dehong"
macss_135,What will my life be like when I am 25? How do children's social class contexts predict their imagined and actual futures?,"Children use school as a way to imagine and strive toward their futures. We analyzed thousands of essays written by children in Britain in the late 1960s about what their lives would be like as adults. We used a bottom-up approach to explore naturally occurring topics in these essays and tested how these topics varied with children's social class context and their adult outcomes. Higher education was the most prevalent topic in these children's essays; children whose fathers—and maternal grandfathers—had higher-status occupations were especially likely to write about this, as well as about interests in teaching, medicine, and the military. Children in lower class contexts were especially likely to write about making money, but also about family and daily responsibilities. We further found that—controlling for family background—children who wrote more about higher education and less about money-making tended to achieve education, status, and income.",2024,"Laurin, Kristin ; Engstrom, Holly R. ; Huang, Muhua"

macss_139,Tides of emotion: the impact of the COVID-19 policy on public sentiment in Shanghai during the city closure,"This study analyzes the impact of six epidemic prevention policies implemented in Shanghai during the COVID-19 outbreak on residents' emotions by analyzing approximately 270,000 posts on Sina Weibo, using the Plutchik Emotion Wheel model and the BERT model. The research covers emotions such as ""disgust,"" ""sadness,"" ""anticipation,""  revealing the dynamic relationship between policies and changes in emotions.Research findings indicate that negative emotions such as disgust and sadness increase significantly during adverse events like the initiation of lockdowns; conversely, positive emotions like trust see a certain degree of increase after favorable events such as the resumption of work. Additionally, the study discovered a substantial rise in the proportion of disgust following the work resumed announcement. This increase stems from the people of Shanghai's dissatisfaction with the sudden lifting of the lockdown leading to potential health risks, discontent with the government's mismanagement during the lockdown, and concerns over their economic repayment capabilities and employment. This paper aims to provide theoretical support for the Chinese government in addressing the next public health crisis, based on the findings of this study.",2024,"Xu, Guangjie"

This study aims to investigate the multitude of factors that influence this decision among LGBT+ individuals. Utilizing the Social Justice Sexuality Project (SJSP) dataset and narratives from the `When I Came Out' repository, we examine sociodemographic, psychological, relational, and environmental determinants. Through machine learning models and sentiment analysis, our findings highlight the pivotal roles of family support, community connection, and personal identity affirmation in the coming out process. By providing a nuanced understanding of these factors, this research seeks to inform interventions and support mechanisms that promote mental health and societal acceptance for the LGBT+ community.",2024,"Hantao, Xiao"

Through both ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression and ordered logit models, the analysis highlights a significant decline in employee satisfaction following M&As, particularly within six months post-event. These findings suggest that M&As negatively affect employee sentiment, emphasizing the importance of considering employee perspectives during M&A processes to mitigate adverse effects and enhance the success of corporate restructuring. The study contributes to the understanding of M&A impacts on workforce well-being and suggests integrating employee-centric strategies in M&A planning.",2024,"Zhang, Yicheng"

By applying a comprehensive analytical framework that includes Odds Ratio (OR) analysis, Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT), sentiment anal- ysis, and contextual analysis, this paper identified patterns of gender-associated language reflecting societal stereotypes. Specifically, words related to approachability and support were used more frequently for female instructors, while words related to entertainment were predominantly used for male instructors, aligning with the concepts of communal and agen- tic behaviors. The study also found moderate to strong associations between male salient adjectives and male names, though career and family words did not distinctly capture gen- der biases. These findings align with prior research on societal norms and stereotypes, reinforcing the notion that LLM-generated text reflects existing biases.",2024,"Huang, Violet"
macss_143,Predicting whole‐brain neural dynamics from prefrontal cortex fNIRS signals during movie‐watching,"Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is growing increasingly popular as a neuroimaging tool for naturalistic settings due to its portability and cost-effectiveness. However, fNIRS is limited to measuring neural activity near the surface of the brain. Can we study neural activity from deeper brain regions in naturalistic settings with fNIRS? In this study, we built a signal prediction model with adapted principal component regression (aPCR) to predict moment-by-moment whole-brain neural dynamics from fNIRS signals during movie-watching. Using a stringent cross-participant and cross-stimulus approach, we were able to predict the neural dynamics across large areas of the brain using only prefrontal cortex fNIRS signals. Predicted neural dynamics recapitulated ground-truth functional connectivity patterns and captured the temporal accumulation of semantic information across temporal, parietal, and prefrontal cortex.",2024,"Gao, Shan"
macss_144,A Comparative Analysis of Product Attributes and Consumer Response in the Fast Fashion Market: Gap Inc.'s Perspective,"This study explores the impact of sustainable product features on consumer behavior within the fast fashion industry, specifically examining Gap Inc.’s integration of eco-friendly practices into its product offerings and consumer-oriented E-Commerce setting. The research uses web scraping techniques to obtain data from Gap’s official online store, analyzing product descriptions, consumer ratings, and fabric choices. The thesis applies statistical methods like point biserial correlation and ANOVA to validate the influence of sustainability on consumer purchasing decisions and satisfaction. Results indicate that products with eco-friendly attributes tend to receive slightly higher ratings and more reviews, suggesting a positive consumer response to sustainability. This research underscores the importance of integrating environmental considerations into business models and highlights the potential for further investigation, such as the effect of comprehensive digital marketing strategies on eco-conscious consumer behavior and the need for more rigorous standards to prevent greenwashing and to enhance sustainability education. By advancing our understanding of the interplay between sustainability and consumer behavior, this study aims to provide insights for businesses aiming to improve their competitive advantage, especially brand image and positioning through sustainable practices.",2024,"Zhang, Celine"
macss_145,Ethical Sourcing and Consumer Demand for Coffee,"We analyze the impact of product labels indicative of ethical sourcing on consumer demand for coffee beans. The paper complements an existing field experiment by re-analyzing the empirical setting under weak assumptions with a more granular level of study which is subject to selection bias. In contrast to standard assumptions on consumer behavior in discrete choice models, this paper takes a fully nonparametric difference-in-differences approach to flexibly capture heterogeneous treatment effects and substitution patterns using spillovers. We also propose plausible structural bounds for partial identification as treatments can switch off in a multi-period setting. We derive semiparametric estimators based on the moment conditions to avoid the negative weighting problems associated with standard fixed effects models under heterogeneity. However by including certain covariates, we show that average effects may be estimated by a simple linear model on specific subsets of the data that achieve balanced propensity scores. Overall we find similar results as existing work, and in particular, the average consumer is sensitive to prices and unwilling to pay a price premium for ethically sourced coffees.",2024,"Wu, Adam"
macss_146,From Free to Premium: A Persona-Based Approach to Understanding Spotify Subscription Upgrades,"In the era of digital music streaming, understanding user behavior and preferences is cru- cial for platforms like Spotify to optimize their services and drive growth. This study aims to investigate the factors influencing premium membership conversion and develop user personas to inform targeted strategies for enhancing user satisfaction and engagement on Spotify. Through a survey of 600 Spotify users, three distinct user segments are identified: free members (59%), free members willing to upgrade to premium (24%), and premium members (17%). Logistic regression analysis reveals key factors influencing premium con- version, including current Spotify plan, premium plan price, and age. To gain a deeper understanding of each user segment, three personas are developed: Nia (free member), Aria (free member with willingness to upgrade), and Sienna (premium member). These personas encapsulate the characteristics, preferences, and pain points of each user segment, providing insights into their needs and expectations from the platform. By leveraging these insights, Spotify can improve user satisfaction, increase premium conversion rates, and maintain a competitive edge in the music streaming industry. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on user experience and premium conversion in music streaming services by synthesizing insights from various data sources and methodologies. It bridges the gap between academic research and industry application, providing actionable recommendations for Spotify and other streaming platforms to drive growth and user engagement.",2024,"Zhao, Zihan"
macss_147,Fertility Preferences and Fertility Outcomes in China: A Two-way Causal Analysis,"This study explores the bidirectional causality between fertility preferences and outcomes in China, using the latest two waves of the Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS 2018 and 2021). The findings highlight significant implications for two contrasting phenomena observed in the data: 1) A progressive shift from son preference to daughter preference overall across cohorts; 2) A persistent gender discrepancy between fertility outcomes and preferences - actual fertility outcomes are more skewed towards boys than ideal fertility preferences suggest. The shift towards the daughter preference can be attributed to the “girl-updating” mechanism: having girls on average reduces the gender gap in preferences by approximately 0.5 children, while the effects of having boys are less consistent. On the other hand, the gender discrepancy between fertility outcomes and preferences can be explained by two behavioral patterns: 18% of the discrepancy comes from people with a son preference taking more aggressive measures to ensure male offsprings, whereas 82% is attributed to the “implicit son preference” among people with a balance preference, who opt for a boy when limited to only one child. Moreover, a dynamic Difference-in-Difference study suggests that during the early stage of birth control policies, urban residents with a balance preference suffer from increasingly stricter constraints of having only one child than their rural counterparts, exacerbating the skewed sex ratio.",2024,"Cheng, Guo"
macss_148,Assessing the Use of Social Media as a Supplementary Tool for Public Opinion Analysis,"This study investigates social media platforms, specifically Twitter, as a tool for analyzing public opinion Within the U.S. regarding foreign countries. By comparing social media data with Gallup polling data as a benchmark, this research evaluates how well sentiments expressed on Twitter align with those captured through conventional surveys. The analysis spans responses concerning several key global players: China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran, focusing on significant political and social events that might influence public perception. The findings demonstrate that while traditional polling captures a snapshot of public opinion, social media offers a real-time reflection of public sentiments. Twitter not only mirrors the general direction of public opinion shifts but also reacts more quickly to global events, thus providing nuanced insights into the immediate public discourse. However, it also tends to maintain engagement with topics for longer periods, potentially lagging in recovering from the immediate impacts of significant events compared to traditional meth- ods. This research highlights the complementary nature of social media analysis in public opinion research. It offers valuable insights into both the possibilities and limitations of using digital platforms for sentiment analysis, suggesting that while they should not replace traditional methods, they are instrumental in providing a more comprehensive understand- ing of public sentiments, especially in response to rapid global developments. This study underscores the importance of integrating various data sources to capture a more holistic view of public opinion dynamics.",2024,"Zhang, Tianxiao"
macss_149,Exploring the Relationship Between Online and Offline Sinophobia Amid COVID-19,"The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified global Sinophobia, leading to escalated verbal and physical assaults on the Chinese diaspora (Cabral, 2021; Reja, 2021; Salcedo, 2021; Than, 2021). Existing research indicates that online rhetoric, especially from prominent figures, can incite real-world racial animosity and aggression (Chan et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2022; Williams et al., 2020). This study first explores the overarching themes of online discourse centering on the COVID-19 news report in the United States, then focuses on the specific narratives that address China and the Chinese community to understand how Sinophobia is manifested and associated with the pandemic. Afterward, it delves into the temporal relationship between online Sinophobic sentiment and offline anti-Asian violence, accounting for the spill-over effect from targeted anti-Chinese antipathy to a broader anti-Asian hostility. Online Sinophobia is measured by comments under YouTube news videos about COVID-19 and Google searches for Sinophobic terms; offline Sinophobia is calculated by FBI hate crime statistics. This study identifies a bidirectional Granger causality between online and offline Sinophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic: anti-Asian hate crimes Granger-cause Google searches for Sinophobic terms, and conversely, these searches Granger-cause offline hate crimes, with a lag of two weeks. Additionally, it confirms a reinforcing dynamic between implicit and explicit online Sinophobia: the volume and intensity of anti-Chinese comments on YouTube news videos lead to increased Google searches for Sinophobic terms, and vice versa, with this effect observable over a ten-week lag. Furthermore, when accounting for confirmed infection cases, online Sinophobia is positively correlated with offline Sinophobia. These findings contribute to the existing literature on the relationship between online racist sentiment and real-life racial violence amidst this global crisis.",2024,"Wang, Yuzhou"
macss_150,Opening the Pandora's Box: Mining Legal Change with Content Analysis,"Sociologists increasingly understand the mutual influence between legal change and social movements; indeed, some social movements are pursued primarily through the judicial system as impact litigations, and require reinterpretation of statutes to succeed. When examining such cases, scholars often focus on doctrinal innovations introduced by higher hierarchies of courts as the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals. However, such a perspective overlooks the adaptation and innovation of legal principles in lower-level courts. Adaptation to new doctrinal changes is not an immediate process, and judges at lower levels can continue to adhere to their established practices; conversely, innovations made by appeals courts can not immediately reorient judicial practice in all realms. This study uses computational methods to analyze the change across all American District Court since 1960s for a substantively important area of law: police misconduct. Social movements that aimed to boost civilian control of police received a major boost when this was reconceived in terms of civil rights, as opposed to, say, organizational corruption. But setting our eyes aside from landmark Supreme Court rulings, where and when did this change originate, and how did this change diffuse through different levels and spaces of the judicial system? By combining case citation analysis and structural topic modeling (STM), we can reproduce the logic by which appeal judges reached for, and reinterpreted, different cases as precedents as they worked to conceptualize police misconduct in ways that appeared better suited for emerging social conditions.",2024,"Leung, Ryan"
macss_151,MUSIC AND SEXUAL IDENTITY: CHANGE IN MUSIC AFTER SELF-DISCLOSING SEXUAL IDENTITY,"Can music reflect the changing nature of sexual identity? How does the change in the sexual identity of LGBTQ+ representation be performed through music? To address these ques- tions, this thesis explores the changing performance of sexual identity through music lyrics. An extensive examination of LGBTQ+ representation in the music industry was conducted by compiling data from Spotify playlists. The sexual identities and self-disclosing dates of 54 selected artists were identified through manual coding, based on cross-checked news sources. Subsequently, the lyrics of all tracks by these artists were scraped from Genius. The collected data underwent various experiments including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, cluster- ing, and text classification techniques to observe changes in sentiment and topics expressed in the lyrics following the artists’ public disclosure of their sexual identities. Results show that: (1) the sentiment polarity could change in different directions depending on the specific characteristics of the artists; (2) artists express more confidence, more positive attitude, and stronger love after publicly disclosing their sexual identities. These findings provide empiri- cal evidence for the relationship between music and sexual identity and the impact of sexual identity on music expression, which addresses a gap in the existing literature by emphasiz- ing the connection between music and sexual identity. Furthermore, this study proves that music could not only reflect sexual identity but also reflect the dynamic change of sexual identity, which provides guidance for future studies in music and sexual identity. The use of computational methods could also provide some insights for future semantic analysis on a large corpus of lyrics.",2023,"Tang, Ning"
macss_152,Scientific Paradigms and Status Hierarchies,"The processes by which scientific knowledge is created, disseminated, evaluated, and organized are permeated by inequalities across social, institutional, and geographic scales. This results in science being a highly stratified, constantly evolving, layered, and global multiscale network. However, not all scientific fields are created equal. While inequalities in science have been widely studied, differences in the conceptual organization of scientific fields have been overlooked. I explore the link between the paradigmatic cohesion of fields and the hierarchical ordering of participating organizations and individuals via citations, as well as through faculty hiring flows. For 11 fields in the social and natural sciences, from 1990 to 2012, and across a plethora of levels and measures, I find robust support for the positive association between scientific paradigms and status hierarchies. Put differently, high paradigm fields exhibit more status inequality in attention, reward and influence than low paradigm fields.",2023,"Baier, Silvan Daniel"
macss_153,Online Behaviors of Social Movement Organizations and Activists,"Social network sites and digital activism allow participants to engage in social movements with lower participation costs and organizing costs, yet with higher risks. Thus, the traditional role of Social Movement Organizations (SMOs) in providing selective incentives is challenged. A comprehensive understanding of social movement, especially digital activism, can only be achieved by recognizing both SMOs’ and individual activists’ contributions. To compare their online roles and abilities with each other, I focused on the Black Lives Matter movement as a case study and leveraged 23.7 million tweets from 5.5 million users. SMOs and individual activists are classified at scale using the RoBERTa model with Lamb optimizer to mitigate sampling bias. I concluded that activists and SMOs have similar online behaviors in overall influences and their contribution to the social movement’s continuity and long-term viability. However, SMOs still dominate in stimulating conversation among new audiences compared to activists and other types of accounts in the online setting.",2023,"Zhang, Lu"

macss_155,Evaluating Chinese Government Investment on Early Childhood Education from 2010-2020: Effective or not?,"This paper assesses the effectiveness of government investment in early childhood education (ECE) services in China over the past decade. It draws on works by Heckman (2004), Cunha and Heckman (2007), and program evaluation studies (Rao et al., 2012) that emphasize the long-term benefits of early childhood investment. This paper evaluates Chinese government’s achievement of objectives outlined in “The Plan” and “The Guidelines”, which focus on improving kindergarten gross enrollment rates and addressing the “3A” issues (Accessibility, Affordability, and Accountability) as specified in China's 13th Five-Year Plan launched in 2010.The study evaluates the two ECE policy efforts (“The Plan” and “The Guidelines”) through matching keywords from these documents and using data from three different sources: official kindergarten enrollment data, CFPS longitudinal survey (The China Family Panel Studies) data initiated in 2010 by Peking University, and news article keyword data from Baidu.com. The study provides an evaluation of government investment in ECE in China, gauging its alignment with objectives outlined in policy documents, and considering the perspectives of both official data as well as media perception through surveys and media sentiment analysis. Findings indicate that even though the official data met the government target objectives on enrollment rate for all provinces, the survey data demonstrates discrepancy that some provinces did not meet the target goal in 2020. This provides insights into the consistency between official data and the perceptions reported by surveyed individuals and households. Furthermore, sentiment analysis of news headlines show a positive trend in media perception of ECE, which helps to investigate the correspondence between media sentiment and official data.",2023,"Hu, Zhiyun"
macss_156,Pricing objectivity: How collectors weigh objective features in pricing art,"How is art valued? How do art collectors understand art and price pieces in the art market? These are long standing research questions that have been limited by data availability and by the clandestine nature of art markets. Drawing upon anthropology, economics, and sociology, the study grapples with the elusiveness of art valuation processes and tests whether these objective factors significantly affect the price-setting behavior of art collectors. By leveraging data-rich blockchain ecosystems, the paper illuminates the intricacies of valuation in the art market and serves as a first study in a longer research agenda on art market exchange and valuation processes. The inaugural sale prices of 2,553 from the same collection of art is evaluated against objective features. Results from an ordinary least squares regression model show that objective values cannot sufficiently explain how collectors decide on art prices. Instead, continued academic exploration into the social and subjective values of art is required.",2023,"Yap, Helen"

Co-optation is one of the broad methods dictators have at their disposal to counteract the dangers of being overturned. The emergence of the Internet and Communication Technologies (ICT) last two decades has provided autocrats with another repertory of techniques: information manipula- tion. I employ a vast collection of Russian-language news in 2018, along with government-provided social support utilities data, to study the Russian gov- ernment’s information manipulation strategies upon major policy change. The findings suggest that information manipulation is a pervasive and powerful tool that is used in autocratic survival, and not only serves as a key tactic but also interacts with conventional survival strategies, such as material co-optatio",2023,"Liu, Jiehan"
macss_158,Unveiling Gender Gaps and Attitudes in the Kitchen: Leveraging GPT Technology for Language Content Analysis on Food.com,"As I helped my fourth-grade sister with her homework, I came across a question that asked her to complete the sentence ""Mom is cooking in the kitchen, she..."". This anecdote led me to ponder the well-established roles of women, particularly mothers and grandmothers, in the kitchen throughout history. To delve deeper into this topic, this research paper utilizes language content from the food.com website, an online community that shares recipes and cooking experiences, to substantiate the gender gaps in the kitchen. Specifically, the study investigates whether women cook more than men and the attitudes of food-makers and food-eaters.  To analyze the collected data, two approaches are employed: the first attempt utilizes supervised machine learning for gender identification, but unfortunately does not yield satisfactory results. However, the second attempt utilizing the successful GPT response generation technique proves significantly more effective. Subsequently, sentiment analysis is conducted using traditional natural language processing methods. The findings of this analysis reveal that the conventional societal pattern of ""women as food-makers and men as food-eaters"" continues to persist in the modern era. Furthermore, both food-makers and food-consumers exhibit positive attitudes towards food; however, food-makers tend to emphasize qualities related to the culinary experience, as well as the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction derived from cooking, while food-consumers place greater value on the emotional aspects of feeling loved and cared for through food. Moreover, this study demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating GPT technology within the realm of big data social science research, despite encountering substantial difficulties and challenges along the way. As the field of AI continues to advance, with the generation of increasingly accurate responses and cleaner formatting, it is anticipated that such technology will prove to be a valuable asset in future research endeavors.",2023,"Ni, Shengwenxin"
macss_159,MARKET’S POLITICAL PREFERENCES: AN ANALYSIS OF MARKET RETURNS AND REALIZED VOLATILITY DURING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS,"Markets and politics are intimately linked. Moreover, the extensive lobbying practices in the US evidence the interest of firms in political outcomes. Some companies go as far as to donate to political campaigns. On the short-term,these donations can signal political leanings and a company’s preference for a particular party to be in power. Hence, it is worth asking whether a firm’s political leaning is a determining factor in their stocks performance, and whether the market prefers a particular leaning over another, especially around the most important electoral event in the US: presidential elections. In this paper, we set out to examine market preferences over companies’ political leanings in the immediate dates after a presidential election takes place. Our hypothesis is that, under normal economic circumstances, markets favor companies who lean toward republican candidates, but under economic stress periods such as recessions, the market is less favorable toward such companies. I look at daily stock prices for a sample of public companies associated with PACs to determine if their stock returns are affected by the companies’ political leaning. I find that election outcomes affect stock returns, but there effects are usually the same regardless of political leaning. The signs of the effects over the post-event window, leading us to conduct a second study to evaluate the volatility of the stocks’ returns. We find democrat-leaning and neutral stocks have higher frequency of significant changes in volatility, while republican stocks are relatively stable, suggesting markets prefer companies that lead republican. The only exception is the 2008 election, where changes in volatility are significant for all stocks regardless of political leaning, indicating shifting preferences probably caused by the recession environment.",2023,"Vadillo, Maria Daniela"
macss_160,DECODING INDIAN MATRIMONIAL ADVERTISEMENTS: INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES ENTRENCHED IN SOCIO CULTURAL BIASES,"Matchmaking is an age-old practice in the Indian context. What started out as a tradition of seeking partners in close-knit communities, has today expanded to newspapers and online websites. These advertisements however continue to be extremely explicit, content-heavy, and rich sources of cultural and socio-economic individual preferences. In this study, I attempt to use this text, along with computational methods, to understand the most important preferences of individuals seeking partners through newspaper advertisements, and how their preferences vary with time. Moreover, I attempt to qualitatively understand how people employ print versus digital media to facilitate the matchmaking process, and how this impacts the relevance of newspaper matrimonial advertisements. I use robust methods of natural language processing and computational linguistics such as part-of-speech tagging and word embeddings to conduct a longitudinal study across years. I argue that individual preferences of brides and grooms are rooted in gender and cultural biases, and remain constant with time. Using newspaper matrimonial advertisements of a north Indian newspaper, The Tribune, from 2001-2014, I find that there exists a bias for “tall”, “slim”, “fair”, and “beautiful” women, and “handsome”, “tall”, and “intelligent” working men, from the Sikh or Jat community. This underscores the fact that these advertisements are embedded in stereotypical gendered roles and a strong emphasis on intra-faith alliances. The results of this research also highlight the increasing preference of individuals towards using online platforms for matrimonial advertisements. In doing so, this study discovers nuanced biases in the social fabric of Indian matchmaking traditions and raises questions about the relevance of newspaper matrimonial advertisements and their implications on the matchmaking ecosystem.",2023,"Iyer, Pranathi"

This research attempts to explicate how the information about the Anti-ELAB Movement was transmitted on Twitter, how and to what extent these messages mobilize people to respond, and what properties in tweets triggered more subsequent actions. The determinants of mobilization are identified by applying social network algorithms and sentiment analysis to locate the chain and tone of conversations. To address the confounders in texts, Topical Inverse Regression Text-Matching (TIRM) ensures the texts are comparable in causal inference modeling.

macss_165,Association between Resting-state fMRI and Inhibitory Control among Psychosis Patients and Healthy Controls,"The ability to inhibit behavior is essential for achieving one's goals and being flexible in response to changing situations. Prior resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies in healthy people have shed light on key brain regions for inhibition performance (Lee & Hsieh, 2017; Tian et al., 2012). It is possible, but untested, that the association between RS-fMRI and inhibition performance seen in healthy controls extends to psychosis and helps predict the range of performance observed. Therefore, we are interested in the question of how inhibition performance is associated with spontaneous brain activity among psychosis patients and healthy people. We will also investigate how different the associations are between these two populations, and within psychosis patients. In this thesis, we expect that positive correlations exist between inhibition performance and spontaneous brain activity represented by RS-fMRI in specific brain regions of interest including default mode network and bilateral inferior frontal cortex. We also hypothesize that these correlations will be significantly weaker for some psychosis subgroups with greater inhibition response impairments. My thesis will fill in the gap in the literature and help characterize neural system alterations in psychosis, which are likely to be heterogeneous between different subgroups. An understanding of the difference in the associations may also help us better explain the decreased inhibition performance previously seen among psychosis patients (Ethridge et al., 2014). Comparison of the association between subgroups of psychosis patients may also illicit explanations for the different inhibition performances between these subgroups that have been previously identified (Clementz et al., 2016).",2023,"Wu, Zhennuo"
macss_166,Wars of Position: A Social Network Analysis of Political Podcasts,"Ideological echo chambers on digital media platforms have been the subject of extensive research by computational social scientists. Current debates focus on the role of user choice and algorithmic recommendation feeds in creating these echo chambers. In this thesis, I argue that content creators can work to create echo chambers through collaborations with other ideologically aligned creators. Adopting a Gramscian theoretical framework, I argue that these homophilic collaborations are tools of hegemonic struggle, analogous to the “wars of position” described by the late political theorist Antonio Gramsci. To validate my claims, I perform a social network analysis of collaborations between the 250 most political podcasters in the United States. My network analysis reveals that collaborations are much likelier between podcasters of similar ideological alignments, and these probabilities are the largest for left-wing podcasters. My research also shows that collaborations are highly unequal, adhering to power law distributions observed commonly across a wide range of social phenomena. My results advocate for a renewed focus on engagement between content creators on social media platforms as a potential driver of political polarization.",2023,"Poongundranar, Thiyaghessan"

macss_168,Self-Disclosure in Psychotherapy: The Development of a Novel Behavioral Measurement via Natural Language Analysis,"While it is widely accepted that clients’ level of self-disclosure has important implications for treatment outcomes and therapeutic relationship, it is difficult to measure. Extant assessment tools fail to capture the fluctuating nature of self-disclosing behaviors, their sensitivity to context and vulnerability to subjective biases. This study sought to address this issue by utilizing a quantitative self-disclosure method assessing distinct linguistic features. Forty-eight participants aged 18-35 were recruited to complete two dyadic, 45-minute conversations with a stranger co-participant. The conversation topics they received either induced high or low self-disclosure. Logistic regression models in combination of natural language processing techniques including a word-count approach (LIWC) and a word-embedding approach (BART) were constructed based on participants’ conversation content to classify high vs. low-level of self-disclosure. A logistic regression model built upon LIWC categories achieved 89.66% accuracy, and the one using pre-trained BART model retained 48.28% prediction accuracy. Incorporating demographic variables did not affect the model built on LIWC but improved the accuracy to 62.07% for the BART approach. Results provides preliminary evidence in support of algorithms that assess language content to predict high versus low-levels of self-disclosure. Limitations were discussed that future studies might improve model performance by recruiting a larger, more heterogenous participant sample to discuss a wider range of topics.",2023,"Yu, Jiachen"

Data from the Chicago Data Portal and the American Community Survey (ACS) are collected for the years 2019, 2020, and 2021. My analysis reveals departmental and technological heterogeneity in the changes in government performance regarding public service delivery depending on the location of the service requests during the study period. My findings indicate that areas with a higher number of educated individuals receives a quicker government response overall during the study period. Furthermore, certain departments exhibit a particularly discriminatory response towards disadvantaged groups only during the pandemic, thereby highlighting the potential for inequitable distribution of government resources under times of stress. Additionally, requests submitted through technology-based channels are prioritized for disadvantaged groups as compared to traditional channels, suggesting the potential of technology to aid the government in achieving more equitable outcomes.",2023,"Zhang, Baotong"
macss_170,Detecting Discourse Pattern: MBTI Personality Traits from Reddit Posts,"Social media nowadays has transformed how people express their feelings and thoughts.Researchers have proved that our online discourses or even a single profile tells a story. However, few studies paid attention to discursive features on those contexts and many of those studies were conducted in black-box approaches. In fact, it matters as researchers can generate insights from those feature interpretations and therefore understand human behaviors online. To further contribute to this field, I investigated people’s frequent words used, sentence length, vocabulary size, and topics they would like to discuss online. This study was designed to narrow down the scope to the online community and especially targeted on posts and comments from Reddit’s MBTI groups, as my goal is to discover discursive patterns among people with similar personality types. Myers–Briggs Type 16 Indicators(MBTI) is a well-known personality assessment, which has been popular since 1980s.

The variety of products can make customers feel overwhelmed when choosing and using them. Currently, Customized E-commerce B2C Recommendation Systems bring convenience to both customers and businesses by improving sales efficiency, solving the problem of information overload, and optimizing the supply chain. Amazon is an American multinational technology company that specializes in e-commerce and has been referred to as one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world. For this project, I will design a Customized E-commerce B2C Recommendation System for Amazon by analyzing Amazon Review Data (Ni, 2018), which is a collection of reviews including ratings, text, helpfulness votes, product metadata like product descriptions, category information, price, brand, image features, and links that are viewed.

macss_172,Estimating the association between suicide rates and rap music lyrics mentioning death and negative emotions,"Music lyrics have been long proven to have emotional as well as moral effects on individuals and society. Among genres of music, rap music, being an important part of American music street culture, is special due to the more important role of lyrics in rap songs. This study took rap lyrics as our research focus and tried to explore their mental influence, taking suicide as the target. A total of 5348 popular rap songs from 1995 to 2018 were obtained from the dataset of Billboard music chart, accessed on one Github public source. Suicide rates over the last two decades were available on the website of the National Institute of Mental Health. Moreover, this study also included several factors that were proven to be strong predictors of suicide, such as unemployment rates, divorce rates, GNP, etc.  A regular regression model and distributed lag model were constructed. The result suggested rap lyrics, mentioning words related to death and negative emotions, could be significantly correlated to suicide rates in the same period. For one unit increase in rap lyrical mentions percentage, the model estimated suicide rates in the same period will rise by around 108 per 100,000 population. The one-year lag association was also significant based on our distributed lag model, and these relationships were confirmed with the cross-correlation analysis. This association implied that there might be a shared cultural context or societal factors that contribute to both the prevalence of these lyrics and the occurrence of suicide. Therefore, the study suggested that there is an important societal issue at play, which requires further investigation and attention. The findings of this study could inform future research on the cultural and societal factors that contribute to mental health issues and suicide, particularly among vulnerable populations who are more likely to be exposed to rap music.",2023,"Chen, Zhiqian"
macss_173,PERFORMING PARENTHOOD: AN ANALYSIS OF MOTHERHOOD AND FATHERHOOD ON TWITTER,"A growing shift in gender roles in society seems to have infiltrated most areas of life, including family relationships such as parental roles. Existing research shows that both men and women are increasing reporting a desire to have more equality in their parenting roles and tasks. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there appeared to be “motherhood penalty” that pushed mothers back into traditional roles. In this thesis, I explore the extent to which parental roles translated online pre- and post- pandemic using a corpus of Tweets posted in 2019 and 2022 that contained the hashtags #DadLife or #MomLife. I examine the differences in tweets posted by fathers and mothers through frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and text embedding. Results show a reinforcement of the traditional stereotypes about roles that mothers have versus fathers have including both physical and emotional roles; however, there is some overlap between these roles as well. The differences in role performance align with the “motherhood penalty” that occurred during the pandemic and translated directly online. In summary, while gender roles have shifted, the underlying expectations of the parental roles that mothers have and fathers have continue to persist in the digital space of Twitter, especially post-pandemic",2023,"Borlase, Kaya"
macss_174,"A Machine-Learning Based Trading Strategy Using Technical Indicators, Fundamental Data, and Insider Trading Information","Building a strategy that can consistently outperform the market index is not an easy task. The goal of this paper is to create a trading strategy that beats the performance of the SPY during the period of 2010-2022. The first step is to predict the relative stock performance of companies in the S&P 500, S&P 400, and S&P 600 indices compared to the overall market performance between two earnings report periods. Insider trading information, technical indicators, and accounting features are used to train machine learning models, providing a more comprehensive profile of each company compared to relying solely on accounting data. Classification models, such as random forest and gradient boosting, are used to make the prediction. The significance of some of the features indicates their predictive power. The second step is to build a long and short trading strategy based on the prediction results and compare it with the performance of a buy and hold SPY strategy. The results show that the random forest strategies outperform SPY during most of the testing periods, and the strategies generate a positive Alpha. The paper provides insights into combining fundamental information and technical indicators to predict future stock directions.

macss_175,Air Freight in the Pandemic: How COVID-related policies impact air freight price index,"Air freight is a crucial part of the global economy, transporting a wide variety of products from electronics to food around the world. However, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to the entire supply chain industry since early 2020, particularly affecting air freight due to grounded flights and travel restrictions, resulting in fewer flights available for transporting goods. In this paper, I provided a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of Covid-related policies on the air freight price index. I captured country-level and category-level heterogeneity of the effects of those policies to offer a detailed understanding of the dynamic changes occurring in air freight pricing. To accurately measure the fluctuations in the air freight industry, I analyzed newspaper data on air freight using sentiment analysis with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. BERT significantly enhances sentiment analysis by leveraging its deep bidirectional understanding of textual context, enabling more accurate and nuanced detection of emotions and opinions in text data. Additionally, conventional datasets of supply chain or air freights tend to be contract-based, but contracts are usually fixed for years, making them unable to respond to changes such as Covid. Through my analysis, I calibrated the real-time trend of the air freight industry and provide valuable insights into the effects of Covid-related policies on the industry. This information would be useful for policymakers, industry leaders, and other stakeholders interested in understanding the impact of the pandemic on the global supply chain. The study found that the issuance of Covid related policies has negative association with the air freight price index. Moreover, the import air freight price index is more impacted compared to the export one. The implementation of International travel controls would suggest a 19.7% decrease to the average import air freight price index.",2023,"Zhang, Wenqian"

Conditional on studying abroad, they were also more likely to select STEM ma- jors during the study and return to China after the study, which accumulates the upper-tail human capital that facilitates early modernization and nation-building. Their preferences for modern education appear to reflect the locally increased nationalism, especially through revolutionist organizations.",2023,"Huang, Yujing"

In this paper, I explore shifts of dollar dominance in post-pandemic periods and the roles and invoicing choices of other major currencies. I find that (i) The dominant role of US dollar is consistent in post-COVID periods; (ii) global prices show stronger contemporaneous responses to exchange rate shocks at monthly frequency; (iii) trade prices and volumes respond more quickly and intensively to dollar exchange rate shocks; (iv) there are regional dominant currencies that dominate US dollar in their territory, and major driving forces of invoicing choices in regional-dominant currencies are trade closeness and foreign market shares.",2022,"Lei, Qihui"
macss_179,Understanding the Role of Worldviews in Identifying Online Toxic Conversations,"Online public discussion has the potential to mitigate the disturbing trend of social polarization. However, as a result of the rise of online toxic behaviors, such benefits have been severely hindered. Based on the social judgment theory, this study examined the role of worldviews in predicting toxic behaviors. This work used toxic conversations on the Reddit changemyview subreddit and analyzed 45 million comments made by 9,546 users across all Reddit communities between 2015 and 2019. This paper found that, combining worldviews with basic text representation features (Word2Vec) on a simple logistic regression led the framework to outperform the state-of-the-art obtained on sophisticated deep learning models. The existence of toxic conversations could therefore be explained by worldviews. This work informs the design of toxicity detection systems to take into account not only the information extracted from current conversations, but also the worldviews shown in the utterances of users over the years.",2022,"Chen, Rui"

Unlike many existing studies that use state or county as the level of aggregation, our analysis uses a sample of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas. Based on our findings, 3G mobile internet has a substantial negative effect on mental health, and instrumenting 3G rollout with pre-existing 2G infrastructure suggests the effects are causal. Young cohorts with high education and income levels are more likely to experience adverse effects on their mental health.",2022,"Xu, Yaling"
macss_181,Identifying Predictors of Lapses in Sustained Attention,"Fluctuations in sustained attention occur at fine time scales. In many cognitive tasks, behavioral measures such as response time can predict the onset of these fine-scale fluctuations. Contemporaneous work has indicated a narrowing trend in the time scales on which predicting sustained attention fluctuations on the basis of fluctuations in functional connectivity among brain regions is possible. Uniting these ideas, we apply connectome-based predictive modeling to derive novel brain networks whose degree of activation may contribute to forecasting upcoming lapses in sustained attention on the order of 2-3 seconds prior to those lapses. We describe these networks’ predictive power relative to canonical and predefined network models of task-relevant cognitive processes as well as models relating response time behavior to upcoming lapses. We find our novel network models offer the best single-feature prediction of upcoming lapses and are essential to their best overall prediction at this scale. More broadly, we find that both neural and behavioral measures may enable the prediction of upcoming attention lapses, but that the signatures of lapsing attention also differ between tasks.",2022,"Chao, Alfred F."
macss_182,"Standing out or Fitting in, Business Pitch and Pivot: Institutional Isomorphism and Differentiation Strategy","The game of “standing out” or “fitting in” is pervasive in the social world. A game faced by individuals and organizations alike, navigating between these two ends and finding a balance become important to the survival and prosperity of the social entity. This reification is especially true for business organizations. While innovation emerges from “standing out” from the rest of the industry, such novelty could also alienate the company from the rest of the pack. On the other hand, fitting into the industry also prevents the company from capturing additional market share and becoming the industry leader. How do companies find this balance? Given the height of U.S. venture capital funding at the moment, at an all time high in 20 years mirroring the funding level of the dot-com boom in the 2000s, the question of standing out or fitting in becomes increasingly important to early-stage companies. To partake and benefit from the venture capital carnival, companies often pivot their products and business models to generate more value to attract investors. Though the startup and venture capital community disagree on the key value drivers of a company, there is consensus on the importance of pivots. What are patterns of pivots and companies that pivot, and do they stand out or fit in overtime with these pivots? In this paper, I investigate this central question through analyzing company description text from Crunchbase (early-stage companies) and annual 10-K’s (mature, public companies). There are three dimensions to this analysis. First, how do companies change their pitches overtime? Second, what drives and results from pivoting? Third, how do companies fit in with the rest of the industry they find themselves in – and how is this different between early-stage v.s. mature, public companies? We hypothesize that pitches become more professional overtime, and that early-stage companies are more likely to pivot and disrupt the industry because pivoting is beneficial.",2022,"Zhao, Chuqing"
macss_183,Large Shock Ties the Hands of Power,"The paper uses dynamic global game model to study the impact of large shock or crisis on the magnitude of corruption for nondemocratic regime. Corruption level impacts citizens’ satisfaction about the regime while large shock, e.g., financial crisis and pandemic, can drastically raise citizens’ dissatisfaction about the government and their incentive for participating in revolution. The model assumes fat-tailed distribution of the common shock that can trigger shift between equilibrium strategies for the citizens, where revolution is more likely to occur in the lower cut-off equilibrium. The multiplicity of equilibria due to nonmonotonic rank belief function of the citizens enables large shock to trigger major attack without a high corruption level. We show that dictator’s fear for the effect of large shock on the outbreak of revolt can disincentivize him from conducting more severe corruptive behaviors. However, if the dictator cares little about the impact of crisis on revolution, he will remain or even intensify the corruption level and thus the threatening effect of large shock would diminish.",2022,"Zhou, Wanxi"
macss_184,How social network sentiments and activities impact cryptocurrencies’ trading volume and volatility?,"This paper studies how the trading volume and volatility of Bitcoin and Ether are impacted by social media such as Twitter and GitHub. Bitcoin and Ether are the two largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization, and represent over 70\% of the total cryptocurrency market in combined value. Twitter and GitHub are two of the most important social network platforms. By utilizing linear regression models on tweets and GitHub activities, I find that tweet sentiments and GitHub activities are important predictors of cryptocurrency's trading volume and volatility. Specifically, as the total number of tweets increase, the cryptocurrency's trading volume and volatility tend to rise. The sentiment in the tweets is also found to be correlated with trading volume and volatility. The positive tweets increase is associated with decrease in the cryptocurrency's trading volume, while the increase in negative tweets leads to larger trading volume in cryptocurrency. When GitHub activities increase, the trading volume and volatility in cryptocurrency decreases. Theses findings suggest that trading volume and volatility in cryptocurrencies have associations with social media platforms.",2022,"Su, Xin"
macss_185,Mortgage Subsidy and Household Welfare,"Mortgage subsidy, particularly in mortgage interest deduction, has been a controversial topic that fewer and fewer debates were willing to touch on. As the third largest component of government tax expenditure, evaluating mortgage subsidy is of great importance when evaluating how effectively the government budget has provided households with better financial well-being. This paper discussed the opponent condition of mortgage interest deduction and its resulted excess burden. Given the subsidy shows vast heterogeneity across income groups and geography due to itemization heterogeneity, I proposed the theoretical explanation by explicitly including unit user cost of housing consumption per the difference in tax deduction choice. I further conducted an itemization share analysis to support my proposition about the relationship between mortgage loan characteristics and itemization decisions. Moreover, I calculated and contrasted the excess burden of itemization carried across income groups and loan-to-value ratio thresholds. I found households with a low loan-to-value ratio are less likely to itemize their tax deduction for receiving the subsidy, and households facing higher mortgage interest rates are more willing to itemize. The excess burden is also distributed unevenly across income groups, same as how the benefits are disproportionately received.",2022,"Zheng, Xiaojin"

macss_187,No Vaccine for Me: Investigating How Misinformation Targeting COVID-19 Vaccines Went Viral on Twitter,"A major action to end the global pandemic of COVID-19 is the vaccine-rollout programs. However, with pervasive online misinformation targeting the vaccine, it has been difficult to reach the vaccination level required to form herd immunity. The wide spread of such misinformation can find its roots in the homophily and polarization of social media platforms, the long-lasting anti-vaccine sentiments, and the uniquely politicized narrative on pandemic in the U.S. Using an established dataset with tweets annotated with stances towards misinformation, the current research compared the features of post narrative and of their authors using natural language processing and network analysis techniques. The main findings included (1) people adopted vaccine misinformation used a less coherent but more provoking narrative, and attached more negative sentiment and concepts to the vaccines; (2) people adopted vaccine misinformation showed generally lower influence on social media; they relied more on fake news websites and followed more people holding hostile attitudes toward the vaccine, which formed newsfeeds with significantly more unreliable, anti-vaccine information that impacted their attitudes and behaviors. This research fostered the understanding of online discussion concerning vaccine misinformation, and may help platforms and public health experts to perform interventions at the right time and on the right targets when addressing vaccine hesitancy.",2022,"Xiong, Zhihan"
macss_188,Behavioral Biases in Consumer Decision Making Process: Evidence from Subsciption Services,"Observation of past usage can be informative about future usage. This paper develops an individual-level static learning model that incorporates a time-varying risk-averse coefficient that depends on consumer’s past experience to examine behavioral biases, and applies it to a dataset from one subscription service provider in the United States. We find strong evidence of be- havioral biases when consumers make choices under uncertainty: accuracy of their past choices does impact their self-confidence level, which in turn impacts their future choices. In particular, both ""Hot-Hand Bias"" and ""Gambler’s Fallacy"" hold in consumers’ decision making processes. Counterfactual simulations show that patients would have made more suitable choices if these behavioral biases can be overcome. This study yields a set of marketing implications for subscrip- tion services and other business modes such as loyalty programs. Optimal marketing strategies should take into account on how to help consumers to become better ""forward-looking"" person.",2022,"Huang, Hongxian"
macss_189,The Role of Hyper-sales on E-commerce -- Evidence from the Platform Subsidies on AliExpress,"Cross-border e-commerce such as AliExpress provides great opportunities for small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to enter into the global market. Using scraping data, this paper investigates the impact of hyper-sales, in fact the platform subsidies, on these SMEs in the context of AliExpress. Noticing that there are many homogeneous products sold by different retailers, I carefully construct 70 groups of identical iPhone cases with 220 products in total and ensure that there are variation of hyper-sales within each group. I show that the variation of hyper-sales across time is high, and this further enables me to use panel data and group fixed effect models to quantitatively estimate the effect of hyper-sales. I found that hyper-sales are in fact effective ways to increase sales controlling the characteristics of the products and sellers - hyper-sales may lead to an increase of 10 units on average for every two days. These results are robust under a suite of robust tests, and there is no heterogeneity between old sellers and new sellers. I also found that consumers may not respond well when the hyper-sales switch too quickly. This indicates that the platform and policy makers may continue using this marketing strategy to help SMEs grow, but they may need to think carefully about who to sponsor and when to sponsor.",2022,"Chen, Zixu"
macss_190,The Determinants of Analyst Forecast Revisions: Evidence From Financial News,"Given the rich information content of financial news and its usefulness for decision-making in analysts in scenarios like earnings estimates, previously found determinants of analyst forecast revisions are reconstructed using the high dimensional word embedding space and financial news data from the Dow Jones Newswires. By building word analogy in the embedding space, I find evidence of analyst optimism associated with downward forecast revisions. Financial feature dimensions such as positivity and certainty are quantified using sets of antonym word vectors, and this enables us to gauge the relational impact of any interested factors on analyst forecast revisions via the determinant dimensions. Furthermore, strongly positive and significant impact of firm-specific sentiments are found via regression methods. These evidence together suggest that financial news provide incremental informativeness in explaining individual-level analyst forecast revisions, and corroborates the critical roles of analyst optimism and firm-specific sentiments in analyst forecast revision decisions.",2022,"Chen, Tian"
macss_191,"Social Media, Misogyny, and Labor Market Outcomes","The practice of employing social media data as the monitor of public discourses and opinions has become increasingly popular with the development of big data techniques and machine learning tools. In this project, I intend to show that social media data can be used to refine the measurement of people’s gender-related attitudes, as a supplement to the traditional survey data. And more importantly, such finer-grinded and cheap-to-collect data may imply prevailing discriminations in local labor markets. To achieve this purpose, I trained a BERT classifier on a publicly available annotated misogyny dataset, and used it to select terms that are highly likely to be included in misogynistic tweets. In addition, I calculated weights for each terms as a measurement of how “efficient” they were in identifying misogynistic tweets. I then used the terms as well as their corresponding weights to construct a county-level Twitter Misogyny Index, and explored its implications on gender gaps in earnings and labor market participations. The results supported Becker (1957)’s taste-based discrimination model, and that each one standard deviation increase in the Twitter Misogyny Index is associated with a 0.02 increase in men-to-women median earnings ratio in case of all 16-year-old-and-above workers.",2022,"Li, Qiuyu"
macss_192,Urban Neighborhoods and Depression: A Spatial Examination of Depression within Areas of Varying Sociodemographic Characteristics,"Urban neighborhood characteristics are vastly diverse and can help to explain social patterns and mental health outcomes. A granular examination of neighborhood sociodemographic factors and the patterns of mobility that are created by the residents within these areas can reveal influences on depression rates. The close ties between sociodemographic factors and neighborhood environmental characteristics, such as mobility, can serve as indicators for why some urban areas are more affected than others. Using data from the American Community Survey, as well as collected geolocational data and depression instances from Twitter users in Chicago and outlying areas, regression and spatial autocorrelational models were developed to determine sociodemographic factor effects on mobility and depression rate in urban neighborhoods. Analysis shows that the percent population of white individuals positively impacted the radius of gyration for a given area, while percent population Hispanic, higher level education, and a higher Gini wealth inequality index has a negative effect on radius of gyration. Models including mobility as an influencing factor of depression show that an increased radius of gyration has a significant effect on higher depression rates, while a higher Gini wealth inequality index also decreases depression rates. All variables were spatially significant, and areas that share similar sociodemographic, mobility, and depression patterns cluster in the city center as well as the outlying areas of Chicago. These findings can help illustrate which neighborhood characteristics should be closely examined when determining patterns of depression, as well as the identifying sociodemographic variables that can be monitored to help support areas with higher depression rates than others.

macss_194,Understanding the Online Gig Worker Community,"This study describes the evolution of the online gig worker community, and the changing content during the pandemic. To empirically capture the effect of the health crisis, I crawled Reddit posts in gig work-related subreddits from January 2019 to April 2022, a period that covered the pre-COVID era and peaks amid the surge of variants. The core research design rests on the classification of gig workers, which is based on the service type and leads to the five user cohorts in this study: in-store grocery shoppers, logistic drivers, food delivery drivers, ridesharing drivers, and e-commerce sellers. Building on the classification, I propose a descriptive framework for understanding the evolution of the online gig work community, with correspondence between each user cohort’s activity and the COVID trend, and modeling of the most common topics before and after the pandemic starts. The findings suggest that the prosperity of online gig worker communities is roughly aligned with the COVID trend, with a different pattern of flux for the following series of COVID waves other than the emergence. While the pandemic has fostered the popularity of new gig work types, some previously popular gig work types involved in physical and location-dependent interactions have lost ground quickly until the promotion of the COVID vaccine. The study proceeds by investigating the changing topics in online discussion. While the impact of the pandemic is nuanced by specific gig work characteristics, similar concerns are echoed in each user cohort. Workers exhibit more prudence on previously underestimated costs of gig work, engage in more interactions with customers, and pour out more negative implications in online discussion.",2022,"Fu, Boya"

macss_198,Credit Constraint and Global Value Chain Participation,"Credit constraints could impose important barriers against firm’s value added exports. Theoretically, my model which incorporates borrowing constraint into exporting firm’s profit maximization problem predicts credit constraints reduces firm export and export intensity. Using data on 66 economies from 1995-2018, I find evidence that the effect of credit constraint vary across industries that have differing levels of external financing and asset tangibility. For exporting countries with more developed financial systems, industries that rely more heavily on external financing experience larger boosts in exports. On the other hand, financially less developed countries export less in industries with fewer collateralizable assets. The effect is more ambiguous when examining export intensity. Overall, I provide evidence that credit constraint constitutes a significant barrier for global value chain participation.",2022,"Xu, David"

macss_200,"Epidemiology of Fall-Related Hospitalizations in Older Adults  (July 2009 – July 2015):  Exploring the national and regional associations with weather, demographic, and socioeconomic variables using machine learning and classic statistical approaches","Falls are a leading cause of injury and death among older adults. There are few studies that use national longitudinal data and multiple weather metrics to explore the complex relationships of environmental risk factors. This thesis compares machine learning (random forests) and classic statistical (mixed-effects Poisson regressions) methods to examine the influence and spatial variation of weather, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics on county fall-related hospitalization rates among adults 65 years and older in the United States. Three county-level data sources were combined: 1) monthly Medicare hospitalization claims from July 2009 – July 2015 with either primary diagnosis or external cause codes indicating an accidental fall (ICD-9-CM codes E880-E888, excluding E887) 2) weather variables scraped from NOAA’s National Weather Service, and 3) sociodemographic characteristics from the 2010-2014 American Community Survey. National and regional modelling was conducted using both methods and each set of characteristics. Weather, demographic, and socioeconomic variables are all important predictors of fall-related hospitalization rates in older adults. Temperatures were the most influential weather variables at the national level and for all regions except the Northeast. The random forests identified that high fall-related hospitalization rates were associated with temperature variability. The mixed-effects Poisson models demonstrated a U-shaped relationship where both high maximum and low minimum temperatures are associated with greater risk at the national level and in the South and Midwest, controlling for relevant sociodemographics. The two modelling approaches are compared, and the mixed-effects Poisson regressions are consistently more accurate likely due to their adjustment for spatial variation and confounding.",2022,"Benson, Jade"
macss_201,Visually Grounded Multilingual Syntax Acquisition,"Children are observed acquiring multiple languages simultaneously from birth without explicit instruction, and the course of development in each language looks very much like the trajectory followed by monolingual children. We try to simulate humans' syntax acquisition of simultaneous multilingualism via a modified Visually Grounded Neural Syntax Learner, an unsupervised neural network model for learning syntax representation. We incorporate a language classifier for the multilingual text corpus and introduce the predicted language label for each sentence to the training process of the VGNSL model. We train multilingual models using Flickr8k data with text in (English, French) or (English, tokenized Chinese). We find that compared to the monolingual model, the multilingual dataset makes the model less accurate for syntax parsing in each language, and more significantly in datasets with high word overlap, such as (English, French) language pairs. The improved version of the model with the introduction of language classifiers can improve the model's accuracy for syntax parsing in each language. However, it still falls short of the accuracy of the monolingual model. Thus it cannot fully simulate the learning performance of simultaneous multilingual children.",2021,"Xing, Zhou"
macss_202,False Positive Brought by Fat-tailed Weights? Re-examine the Impact of China’s Retaliatory Tariff to US House Election,"This paper scrutinizes the possible violation of some WLS presumptions in empirical projects. In general, for the WLS estimator to be consistent, asymptotically normal and Eicker-Huber-White’s heteroskedastic standard error to converge to a non-random limit, one needs to make sure that the first and second moment of the interaction of weights, regressors, and noise are finite. This paper aims to raise the concern of the contamination of fat-tailed weights in a series of papers that adopts American county or American CZ as its observations and weights the observation by its population. This would compromise the consistency and asymptotic property of the estimator. I used a Monte Carlo experiment to see the potential effects of fat-tailed weights on regressions and proved that under fat-tailed weights, the Eicker-Huber-White’s variance- covariance matrix estimator generally understates the real variance-covariance matrix, and is inefficient. I then take Blanchard et al. (2019) as an example and replicated their work but rezoned their regression observations. In my replication, I found no evidence for the claim that the retaliatory trade shock from China shifts American voters to the Republican Party and this could very likely be a consequence of the fat-tailed weights.",2021,"Sun, Ye"

Government attorneys are assigned either by the judge or in a pseudo-random manner through a rotation system. However, there are concerns over the mechanism by which attorneys are assigned as some mechanisms may impact case outcomes. Using the juvenile criminal records of 37 counties in America in 1998, this study examines how the assignment mechanism affects indigent defendants’ chances of being convicted. In terms of a reduced risk of conviction, I find that quasi-random assignment results in better outcomes for defendants. This paper elucidates that in counties where the judge assigns attorneys, the assigned counsels are more likely to persuade their defendants to plead guilty, which contributes to the disparities in case outcomes.",2021,"Guo, Haihao"

We find that UGC on creative outlets contains more positive brand sentiments and emotional trigger words. UGC on self-media and collaboration platforms are brand-centered, while the most popular topics on self-media are brand news/trends, and it is a product-related question on collaboration platforms. UGC on creative outlets are self-promoting, while creators’ motivations and achievements are the most popular on Instagram, and activity-related content and informative reviews are the most popular on YouTube. Besides, the formation of brand communities positively influences consumer engagement on social media.

I quantitatively measure the economic and non-economic factors that might influence divorce using British Household Panel Study. According to the results of my baseline model, only match qualities matter in predicting the probability of separation. My results also provide some key insights for extensions of this baseline model. The economic and non-economic factors are best at predicting separation that happens within a 3-years time range. And wives’ match qualities have similar effects with the husbands’ when looking at sep- aration hazards in the long run. After controlling for marriage duration, negative match quality received by the husbands will significantly increase divorce hazards, while the reverse is true for wives. Contrary to previous findings, none of the economic factors are significant in my models.",2021,"Chen, Chi"
macss_206,The effects of industrial land market reform on the local governments’ land supply decision in China,"This study examines the effect of industrial land market reform on the local governments' land supply decision in China. Since 2007, the central government has required that each land parcel for sale must be sold to a proposed industry through public auction. The unit transaction price of these sales (yuan per square meter) must be higher than the county-level minimum price, unless permitted by the central government. Therefore, the local governments are no longer able to sell industrial land parcels at low prices to attract firms and are forced to consider the comparative advantages of their land for particular industries. In order to analyze the local governments' land supply decision after the reform, I develop a theoretical model in which I treat the local governments as monopolist land suppliers subject to the central government's auction and minimum price restrictions. The model predicts that the local governments are responsive to the comparative advantages. In addition, when the relationship between the transaction price and the minimum price changes, the local governments can be more or less responsive to their comparative advantages, depending on the revenue from land sale, the positive externalities from the firms, and the reference of the central government. I employ detailed parcel-, county-, and industry- level data to test the model predictions. My empirical findings suggest that a one percentage point increase in the employment share of an industry leads to a 1.3% - 1.6% increase in the land supplied to that industry ceteris paribus. Moreover, the local governments become more responsive to the comparative advantages when the transaction price is lower than the minimum price. These findings verify the implications of the theoretical model. Furthermore, the effects are heterogeneous among counties; the local governments of more developed counties are more responsive to the comparative advantages.",2021,"Yang, Minghao"

macss_210,The Twitter Network of Think Tank Experts in D.C.,"The influence of a political idea rarely relies only on a few scholars and politicians.

Previous research on the roles of policy experts in the policy making process, however, focus primarily on celebrities whose personal connections with other political actors are more publicly visible and politically influential. Two narratives are thus missing: First, what are the roles of the majority of lesser-known experts? Second, how much are experts’ cooperation and communication shaped by organizations such as think tanks? To provide a more complete picture, I construct a Twitter follow graph which covers 609 experts with valid Twitter accounts, which is about 70% of all listed experts on the websites of the Brookings Institution, the American Enterprise Institute, the Center for American Progress, and the Heritage Foundation. Then, I analyze the structure of this Twitter follow graph and explore the implication and limits of Twitter-based connections. With a DeepWalk Algorithm, I argue that the Twitter connections among experts are highly reciprocal and organizationally based. Finally, with edge-based regressions, I show that the organizational based connection between experts is significant even when the similarity of experts’ policy interest is controlled. That is, social media usage seems ineffective in exposing experts to opinions from those beyond the reach defined by their offline constraints. In all, I construct a framework to study the expert network through Twitter data and provide a complementary narrative to the existing qualitative discussions on how opinions and information may circulate among policy expert networks.",2021,"Liang, Chen"
macss_211,Promoting nationalism or becoming apolitical? Understanding China’s response to the crisis on Weibo,"Online social media has become one of the most important ways for authoritarian regimes to maintain their resilience. When authoritarian regimes are faced with challenges, what options would they take to defend their regime? This paper takes Hong Kong protests and early-stage COVID-19 as two examples to study how the Chinese official Weibo accounts responded to these crises. This paper leverages text analysis to mine, explore, and learn from Weibo posts related to these crises. This paper seeks to answer how do these Weibo accounts change during and after the crises, including their word frequency, topic, keywords, and sentiment scores.",2021,"Li, Yimin"
macss_212,SHAP-Guided Adversarial Training for Robust Interpretability in Asset Pricing,"During the post-COVID volatility regime, many traditional and machine-learning asset pricing models failed to provide stable explanations of return drivers. Shifts in factor attributions undermined confidence in reported risk exposures and led to costly portfolio adjustments, such as the misclassification of quality factors during the 2020 market shock. While predictive accuracy is often the primary benchmark, our objective is to improve the stability of model explanations over time so they remain both economically relevant and reliable for decision-making. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to embed attribution metrics directly into adversarial training for non-differentiable financial models. We develop a SHAP-guided adversarial training approach that constructs perturbations along SHAP-derived directions, simulating adversarial stress without requiring gradient access. This design directly regularizes attribution-relevant input sensitivity during training. Perturbation strength is calibrated through an epsilon-sweep, revealing a non-monotonic trade-off between interpretability and performance: while epsilon = 0.05 maximizes attributional stability, a more moderate epsilon = 0.005 balances robustness with economic signal retention. We evaluate the framework using monthly U.S. stock data from CRSP spanning 1990–2024, partitioned into training (1990–2010), validation (2011–2019), and test (2020–2024) periods. Model performance is assessed along three dimensions: predictive accuracy (MSE, IC), economic relevance (Q10–Q1 portfolio spreads), and attributional robustness (SHAP variance, rank correlation, and directional mean drift). A naive random-sign adversarial baseline is included for comparison. Empirically, SHAP-guided models deliver substantial gains in attributional coherence: SHAP variance falls by over 90%, and feature rank correlation across regimes improves from 0.20 to 0.90. These improvements transform highly unstable explanations into consistent, regime-robust factor profiles. The explanatory focus shifts from fragile, regime-dependent signals like momentum toward persistent, risk-consistent features such as volatility and max down, aligning with investor behavior during crises. These results demonstrate that attributional stability can be explicitly optimized without sacrificing predictive performance, and that it carries clear economic value. In volatile markets, maintaining consistent explanations is as critical as predictive fit for ensuring reliable portfolio allocation, credible economic interpretation, and effective model governance. By design, the SHAP-guided adversarial training framework is model-agnostic and readily transferable to other asset classes and predictive tasks where interpretability is essential, enabling deployment in real-world investment and risk management workflows without imposing explicit economic priors.",2025,"Zhang, Sitong"
macss_213,Values in Crisis: How the Great Recession Reshaped the government’s personality Evidence from a Difference-in-Differences Framework Applied to Political Speech Data,"The 2008 Global Financial Crisis significantly disrupted economies across the world, presenting a unique opportunity to examine how economic shocks influence the cultural values expressed by governments. This thesis investigates whether and how the crisis reshaped governmental value expression by analyzing political speeches from four European countries—Spain and Italy (treatment group) and Germany and the Netherlands (control group)—from 2006 to 2010. Leveraging Schwartz’s theory of basic human values and a novel OpenAI GPT-4o-based pipeline for computational value extraction, I quantify the relative emphasis placed on ten value dimensions within each speech. Employing a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) framework, the study isolates the causal impact of the crisis on governmental value orientation. Findings reveal that, contrary to theories predicting authoritarian or dominance-oriented reactions, crisis-affected governments significantly increased their emphasis on benevolence-oriented values. These results are robust across multiple specifications, placebo tests, and sensitivity analyses, including data sampling adjustments. This study contributes methodologically to value quantification using large language models, and theoretically to our understanding of how elite political discourse adapts toeconomic upheaval by signaling solidarity and moral responsiveness.",2025,"Zhang, Hongkun"
macss_214,Strategic Patent Acquisitions: The Role of Technological Proximity and Patent Portfolio Size,"I develop a theoretical model in which firms make strategic patent acquisition decisions based on technological proximity and patent portfolio size. Firms derive higher value from patents that closely align with their existing technology, while the marginal benefit of additional patents diminishes as portfolios grow. Using a two-step estimation approach, I analyze patent transaction data and find that technological proximity positively affects patent value, whereas patent portfolio size exhibits diminishing returns. The negative effect of portfolio size is more pronounced for large firms and manufacturing industries. The results suggest that firms should strategically balance technological alignment and portfolio expansion.",2025,"Li, Guankun"

macss_216,Differential impact from individual versus collective misinformation tagging on the diversity of Twitter (X) information engagement and mobility,"Fears about the destabilizing impact of misinformation online have motivated individuals and platforms to respond. Individuals have increasingly challenged others’ online claims with fact-checks in pursuit of a healthier information ecosystem and to break down echo chambers of self-reinforcing opinion. Using Twitter (now X) data, here we show the consequences of individual misinformation tagging: tagged posters had explored novel political information and expanded topical interests immediately prior, but being tagged caused posters to retreat into information bubbles. These unintended consequences were softened by a collective verification system for misinformation moderation. In Twitter’s new feature, Community Notes, misinformation tagging was peer-reviewed by other fact-checkers before revelation to the poster. With collective misinformation tagging, posters were less likely to retreat from diverse information engagement. Detailed comparison demonstrated differences in toxicity, sentiment, readability, and delay in individual versus collective misinformation tagging messages. These findings provide evidence for differential impacts from individual versus collective moderation strategies on the diversity of information engagement and mobility across the information ecosystem.",2025,"Kim, Junsol ; Wang, Zhao ; Shi, Haohan ; Ling, Hsin-Keng ; Evans, James"

Borrowing from the methodologies of Natural Language Processing, unsupervised machine learning, and social network analysis, I choose the United Nations General Assembly resolutions and voting data as a proxy for diplomatic alignment and show that different issue areas in international politics will yield alliance structures that are often in disagreement with the most widely used frameworks but align with our understanding of the dynamism of modern international politics.

macss_219,The Relationship Between Religious Centers and Urban Development: Evidence from Ghana,"A large number of churches and mosques have been recently established in Ghana. Local policymakers and foreign philanthropists politically and financially support establishing these houses of worship due to their assumption regarding a causal relationship between religious centers and neighborhood development. The current study aims to test whether the assumption regarding a causal link holds by extracting and analyzing features from satellite images and conducting a spatial clustering analysis. The results indicate that religious centers are more likely to be constructed in fast-growing neighborhoods with certain characteristics. However, there are no signs of them changing temporal trends in urban development. Religious centers are more likely to be established in middle-class neighborhoods with high population density and above-average rates of illiteracy and unemployment. In addition to testing the mentioned assumption, the results shed some light on the influence of demand-and-supply factors versus socioeconomic and accessibility variables on the spatial distribution of religious centers.",2023,"Eshtiyagh, Javad"
macss_220,Differential Impacts of Water Privatization in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Countries in Africa have historically struggled with access to safe water. Over the past three decades, the World Bank has promoted the privatization of water systems through contracts with foreign companies as the solution to the water crisis. However, only a handful of privatization efforts in Africa have succeeded, with most governments taking back control of their water supplies after only a few years. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that expanded water access resulting from privatization only occurs in wealthier communities, however this has not yet been confirmed. This thesis examines the relationship between functional water access points in Tanzania, Ghana, Mozambique, and Nigeria and the income levels of the neighborhoods in which they are located, analyzing how this relationship changes before and after privatization. This quantitative approach was accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the political, economic, and geographical features of each country. When combined, these two complementary avenues of analysis demonstrate that privatization did not significantly increase water access but there was insufficient evidence to make definitive conclusions about privatization’s effect on inequalities. This thesis argues that certain models of privatization should not be promoted as primary solutions to water access because they do not appear to increase water access. Furthermore, it demonstrates the inefficacy of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to expanding water access and indicates the need for solutions that are adapted to local situations.",2021,"Varma, Asha"
macss_221,Empathy and redemption: Exploring the narrative transformation of online support for mental health across communities before and after Covid-19,"This study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals’ mental health and their online interactions, particularly within Reddit’s mental health communities. By analyzing data from 15 subreddits categorized into mental health and control groups from 2018 to 2022, we observed that forums dedicated to mental health exhibited higher levels of user engagement and received more supportive responses than those in other categories. However, as the pandemic evolved, a significant decrease in online support was noted, especially within these mental health groups. This decline hints at a risk of emotional burnout among users, which poses a particularly acute challenge for individuals grappling with mental health issues. Intimate relationships have also an impact on online expression of mental health. The research underscores the pandemic’s effect on online support and interaction dynamics, signaling the necessity for a deeper understanding and the development of strategies to maintain support within online communities during times of crisis.",2024,"Cai, Yuxuan ; Wei, Ertong ; Cai, Xintong"
macss_222,Gender Representation of Psychosocial Factors in Role-Playing Video Game Dialogue,"This study investigates gender differences in the linguistic construction of character dialogue within role-playing video games, focusing on psychosocial factors. A corpus of game dialogue was analyzed using both a lexicon-based dictionary and a transformer-based emotion classification model. Basic linguistic analysis revealed that player characters spoke significantly more lines, sentences, and words than non-player characters but used simpler sentence structures. However, no significant gender differences were observed in these linguistic metrics. Word frequency analysis showed that female characters used significantly more language associated with cognitive reflection and social connection, whereas male characters exhibited higher rates of swear word usage. Emotion classification revealed that female non-player characters expressed a broader range of emotions, including more disgust, sadness, surprise, joy, and fear, while male characters showed a stronger association with anger. Principal component analysis identified an affective positivity–negativity axis that significantly predicted gender, with male characters clustering toward greater negativity. Analysis of neutral characters indicated that their psychosocial profiles most closely resembled male characters, supporting the notion of masculine defaults. These findings highlight how gendered psychosocial patterns are embedded in video game dialogue and reveal both persistent stereotypes and emerging shifts toward more balanced gender representation in interactive narratives.",2025,"Yan, Weiwu"
macss_223,A System-Agnostic Approach to Computational Ideology Detection: An analysis of Colombian congressional Speech (2000-2024),"This study proposes a system-agnostic, modular approach for detecting ideological structures in political discourse without relying on predefined ideological axes or external labels. Building on a sociological understanding of ideology as the rationalization and narrative construction of political action, the method combines topic modeling, narrative mining, and frequent itemset analysis to inductively reconstruct ideological patterns from large-scale political speech. Applying this pipeline to a corpus of Colombian congressional interventions (2000–2024) revealed three major attitudinal stances toward peace processes, alongside narrative bridges linking economic governance, institutional trust, and post-conflict reform. These findings demonstrate that ideological structures can be systematically detected through emergent speech patterns, offering a flexible and culturally sensitive alternative to traditional ideology detection models. The results highlight new possibilities for computational social science in fragmented political contexts, particularly in regions like Latin America, where labeled data is limited and ideological systems are fluid.",2025,"Sarria-Morales, Alejandro"

In two studies (N = 1,610), we found that (a) people prefer biased humans to consult unbiased AI, (b) people prefer unbiased humans to avoid consulting biased AI, and (c) people lean towards wanting biased humans to consult biased AI. Although people prefer not to utilize algorithmic aids when the human decision-maker is unbiased, people do not always react negatively to algorithms. Algorithms can be a more permissible decision aid for potentially biased humans.

macss_226,Investigating Job Seekers' Alignment with Job Market Skill Requirements: A Study of Data Scientist Profiles,"The job search process is crucial for individuals seeking employment, particularly for those without work experience, such as recent graduates. This research aims to examine the behavior of job seekers by investigating whether their profiles align with the skills required in job postings, focusing on data scientists. The study seeks to understand job search patterns and provide recommendations to job seekers on skill acquisition and job fit to improve their chances of securing employment. The research employs an N-gram model to extract job skills from job postings and user profiles, cosine similarity to calculate person-job fit scores, and collaborative filtering methods for skill recommendations. Data is collected from two groups: employed data scientists and students actively seeking data scientist positions. The results indicate that job-seeking students possess skill sets closer to the job market demands compared to employed data scientists. This suggests that recent graduates or those transitioning into new careers may be better prepared to meet job market needs than those already employed in the field. Furthermore, job postings display a more even distribution of similarity to job seekers' skill sets, implying that job seekers have a wider range of opportunities available as their skills align with various job postings. The regression analysis conducted in this study shows that the similarity coefficient was positive but not statistically significant, indicating the potential of similarity as an indicator of employment status change for both job-seekers and employed data scientists. However, the explanatory power of the similarity score appeared to be lower for those actively seeking a job, possibly due to their increased activity in the job market. This research has the potential to guide job seekers in skill development and improve their chances of finding suitable employment.",2023,"Chou, Yu-Hsuan"
macss_227,How Political Bias Manifests on the Digital Front Pages of US-Based News Media,"Media bias is a topic that attracts significant scholarly attention. Today, digital news media has become the primary news source for the public, but the exact manner in which political bias is reflected on the digital front pages of news media remains an under-explored topic. This study aims to fill this gap by systematically analyzing the headlines from 44 prominent U.S. news sources representing a broad political spectrum, collected bi-hourly from January through February 2024. This paper is among the first to utilize high-frequency data collection methods to examine the highly dynamic front pages of news media. Focusing on political news topics on the front pages, the findings of this paper suggest that news outlets feature political figures with opposing ideologies more prominently than those that align with the media’s political stance. Additionally, it was observed that media organizations frequently report on similar political topics simultaneously, but the tone of their coverage varies according to their political bias. These preliminary results could have broad implications for future research aimed at understanding and addressing media bias. Furthermore, this research demonstrate the effectiveness of high-frequency data collection to study digital news.",2024,"Zhang, Tianze"
macss_228,"The Language of Bias: Examining the Influence of Political Bias and Electoral Context on Emotional, Moral, Intergroup Language and Sentiment in News Media","In an era of increasing political polarization, the language used by news media has become a crucial area of investigation. This study investigates the relationship between political bias and language usage in news articles, focusing on the use of emotional, moral, intergroup language, and sentiment. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 2,510,592 news articles from 234 publishers spanning the years 2010 to 2022, I seek to shed light on the linguistic strategies used by media outlets to influence public perception and opinion. My approach combines a novel Transformer-Dictionary Hybrid method for identifying emotional, moral, and intergroup content with sentiment analysis using the VADER tool. The study addresses two key research questions: 1) How does the usage of emotional, moral, and intergroup language differ among news publishers with different political biases? 2) Do news outlets employ this language differently during election years compared to non-election years? ANOVA and mixed linear model analyses reveal significant differences in the usage of emotional, moral, intergroup language, and sentiment across publishers with different political biases. Liberal publishers tend to use more emotional and moral language compared to left-leaning and neutral publishers. Intergroup language usage is significantly lower among neutral publishers compared to liberal ones. Sentiment analysis shows that conservative publishers express a more negative sentiment compared to liberal publishers. A two-way ANOVA examining the effect of election years shows a significant interaction between language dimensions and election cycle. Mixed linear model analyses reveal a decrease in intergroup language usage and a slight decrease in positive sentiment during election years. The findings contribute to our understanding of how political bias and electoral context influence the linguistic choices in news media. The results suggest that partisan outlets strategically employ language to engage and potentially polarize their audience, while adapting to the heightened political climate of election years. These insights shed light on the complex interplay between language, media bias, and political polarization, underlining the importance of media literacy in navigating the contemporary media landscape.",2024,"Jiang, Yutong"
macss_229,Understanding What People Need from Visiting Green Spaces During the Pandemic: An Analysis of Visitation Patterns by Integrating Multimodal Data,"During the pandemic, visiting counts, dwell time, and travel distance to green space significantly declined. Previous studies have not fully explained why this pattern occurred, as they lack the simultaneous inclusion of both objective features and visitor’s experience, and do not explicitly distinguish visitation patterns into three categories. To examine how U.S. green space visitation patterns changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, I integrated Google reviews, Street View images, and the Social Vulnerability Index with GPS-based visitation data to examine how experience, environmental features, and socioeconomic sta- tus affected green space visitation, and further to identify features that fulfill basic and non-basic needs in different time periods. Machine learning models were used to transform raw data into numerical metrics and capture the non-linear impact of these features on green space visitation. The findings reveal that during the pandemic, basic needs such as green coverage and road are regarded as the most important. Non-basic features, such as water activities and sports, can still attract a smaller proportion of visitors, provided they have access to these green spaces.",2025,"Chen, Anzhi"

Hypothesis 1 reveals that male collaborations use more derogatory language than male solo artists, amplifying violence through group dynamics. Hypothesis 2 shows that anger, as an automatic tool to assert dominance among Colombian male artists, aligns with Raewyn Connell’s concept of hegemonic masculinity. Hypothesis 3 reflects Judith Butler’s theory of gender performativity, demonstrating how women embody societal scripts of nurturing and compliance shaped by the male gaze. These findings support Veena Das’s notion of language as a tool of everyday violence.The results emphasize the role of popular music and culture in perpetuating gendered narratives and societal norms in Colombia. Future research should investigate emotional expression in Spanish-language lyrics, assess the severity of derogatory language, and examine the cultural construction of female desire.

Using data from two field experiments involving 2,410 participants collected for a separate study (Donkor et al., 2023), this research investigates how subjective beliefs and preferences influence bettors’ decisions, revealing that both biased beliefs and preferences contribute to the longshot bias. Participants tend to underestimate the win probabilities of favored teams and overestimate those of underdogs, affecting their betting allocations accordingly. Conditional on betting odds and subjective beliefs, participants also tend to allocate smaller (larger) bets on favored (underdog) teams winning a given match. This research underscores the importance of understanding and addressing the underlying cognitive and psychological factors driving longshot bias to foster more rational betting practices.",2024,"Chen, Zihua"

These new elements can be used for various pragmatic purposes, including conveying politeness. This paper, by investigating the CMCs in an online community that specialized in communications for gamers, successfully replicates the prior results of politeness function of emoji and emoticons. In addition, this paper demonstrates that when a speaker whose primary language has richer linguistic elements for politeness communicates politely in English, that speaker is more likely to use emoji and emoticons than a speaker whose primary language has less rich linguistic elements for politeness. The paper also simulates a simple listener model, which suggests that the presence emoji or emoticons may increase the likelihood of perceiving an utterance as politer.

This paper draws on resource dilution theory to develop hypotheses about the presence of siblings that I test with data from the Health and Retirement Study linked to the 1940 U.S. Census. Using latent growth curve models with reweighting weights by the childhood family and contextual covariates, I estimate the long-term causal influence of sibship. A fully-adjusted model shows that having co-residing siblings in childhood is associated with faster cognitive decline in late adulthood but not with baseline cognitive functioning. The results also show heterogeneities by siblings’ gender composition, with older men with only male siblings showing the worst baseline cognitive function in later life, whereas older women with sisters only face steeper cognitive decline. The paper suggests resource dilution between siblings may cumulatively influence cognitive aging.",2024,"Chen, Zihua"

This reach affords news media significant social influence. Analyzing news articles at scale can reveal latent trends in news media, which ultimately have the potential to be norm-setting. In this study, we implement computational tools to reveal large scale trends in news reporting. Specifically, we integrate NER parsing, record linkage (in the form of gender prediction), topic modeling and word embeddings to reveal trends both in the corpus overall, as well as specific to gendered contexts. Named Entity Recognition and record linkage to isolate contexts in which an individual is reported on (and predict the individual’s gender in order to make larger claims about gender representation in news media). These contexts are then used to train the word embeddings: illuminating differences in the semantic contexts and roles for women/men in news media contexts.

Using a large-scale dataset spanning over three years, this research employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify prevalent discussion topics and utilizes machine learning modeling to investigate factors influencing post engagement. The findings reveal that discussions primarily center around research advice, emotional expression, and feminist discourse, aligning with broader literature on online social support and gendered digital engagement. The results highlight that historical user activity, emotional intensity, and participatory behaviors strongly predict engagement levels.

macss_236,The Features that Drive the Memorability of Objects,"Despite decades of study of memory, it remains unclear what makes an image memorable. There is considerable debate surrounding the underlying determinants of memory, including the roles of semantic (e.g., animacy, utility) and visual features (e.g., brightness) as well as whether the most prototypical or most atypical items are best remembered. Prior studies have also relied on constrained stimulus sets, preventing a generalized view of the features that may contribute to memory. Here, we collected over one million memory ratings (N=13,946) for THINGS (Hebart et al., 2019), a naturalistic dataset of 26,107 object images designed to comprehensively sample concrete objects. We uncover a model of object features that is significantly able to predict image memorability, covering over half of the explainable variance. Within this model, we find that semantic features have a stronger influence than visual features on what people will remember. Finally, we examined whether memorability could be accounted for fully by the atypicality of the objects, by comparing three complementary measures using human behavioral data, object feature dimensions, and deep neural network features. We discover, surprisingly, that the relationship between memorability and typicality is more complex than a simple positive or negative association, however, generally, prototypical objects are the most memorable. Taken together, our findings reveal important structural features underlying the organization of information in memory.",2022,"Kramer, Max"
macss_237, A Multimodal System: Integrating Mobility-on-Demand and Urban Public Transit Network,"With the emergence of the sharing economy, the Mobility-on-Demand service becomes a complement to traditional urban transportation. To alleviate the urban traffic congestion as well as slowing global warming, the government should encourage the use of public transit to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and their carbon emission. However, the existence of the first-mile and last-mile problems creates barriers for commuters to access their local public transit. This paper attempts to solve these problems by designing a multimodal transportation network that integrates a Mobility-on-Demand service and the public transit system. This MoD service connects commuters between their home or destinations with nearby transit stations, and is op- erated by the local government. In this paper, we discuss an optimization problem that tries to find the optimal service radius of the MoD service for each service zone that maximizes the aggregate number of commuters using public transportation. We also provide an empirical case study of specific districts of New York City to show that the introduction of the Mobility- on-Demand service could efficiently reduce the number of vehicles on the road.",2021,"Feng, Linghui"
macss_238,Coupled Social Rewards and Toxicity in Online Political Discussions,"As online presence and engagement in social media become more common, they also become more plagued with toxicity (\cite{cheng2015antisocial, rajadesingan2020quick, wulczyn2017ex, guberman2016quantifying, bogolyubova2018dark}). Social rewards, like votes, are designed to promote productive content but might have unintentionally helped toxic content spread over social networks and motivated producers to continue behaving uncivilly, particularly in political spaces (\cite{wang2016catching, frimer2023incivility}). Additionally, studies show that toxic behaviors can have widespread negative effects, exacerbated by features like recommendation algorithms on social media platforms (\cite{kim2021distorting, shmargad2022social, brady2023algorithm}). Understanding the interaction between social rewards and toxicity is crucial. Analyzing over 500 million comments from more than 400 political subreddits on Reddit, I found strong evidence supporting a coupled relationship between social rewards and toxicity in online political discussions. Highly-voted comments tend to be more toxic. Users may alter the toxicity level of their comments based on the scores their past comments received: the majority choose to increase the toxicity of their future comments if they received higher scores previously. Furthermore, some subreddit characteristics can strongly predict  community variations in users' reward learning for toxicity behavioral patterns. This work provides an insight regarding online toxicity from a reinforcement learning perspective and highlights how we might tackle the toxicity issue by paying attention to users who are susceptible to the bind rewards-toxicity dyad.",2024,"Mao, Hongkai"
macss_239,Deep Neural Network Approaches for High-Dimensional Stochastic Control Problem with Reflected Brownian Motion,"High-dimensional optimal control problems for Reflected Brownian Motion (RBM), common in finance and operations, are challenging due to the curse of dimensionality in solving Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. This thesis explores deep learning solutions for RBM drift control under discounted costs, leveraging Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) and Malliavin calculus to derive probabilistic representations for the value function gradient. Two distinct deep learning algorithms using these representations are compared: Method 1 directly minimizes a loss function based on an explicit Malliavin gradient formula using a single neural network; Method 2 employs a nested iterative structure, using Deep Picard Iteration (DPI) principles to solve a Malliavin-derived fixed- point equation for the gradient via simpler regression steps. Numerical experiments on a 1D benchmark, motivated by optimal liquidation problems in finance, show both methods achieve high accuracy against analytical solutions. However, Method 2 demonstrated superior robustness, converging reliably across different control bounds without the loss function modifications and careful learning rate tuning required to stabilize Method 1 under more challenging conditions. The findings suggest the iterative DPI approach (Method 2) offers enhanced stability and practical advantages for this class of problems.",2025,"You, Zhicheng"

The research primarily focuses on two types of campaign optimization options—click-optimized and view-optimized—and examines how these approaches influence the demographic composition of the audience and, consequently, the results of ad-effectiveness tests. Using a combination of logistic regression and chi-square tests, we provide empirical evidence that Facebook's algorithms significantly shape the substantial differences in both reach and click-through rates (CTR) between treatment and control groups, even after controlling for available demographics. The findings emphasize that experiments on Facebook do not operate under traditional random assignment, complicating the interpretation of treatment effects. This study contributes to our understanding of Facebook experimental results in social science research and the generalizability of its interpretations.",2024,"Zhang, Xinyi"
macss_241,The Double-Edged Sword of IP Location Disclosure: Caution or Discrimination? A Study of Regional Hate Speech on Chinese Social Media,"This study investigates how IP location disclosure affects online hostility, with Weibo serving as the main platform for analysis. A fine-tuned Chinese RoBERTa model jointly classifies hate speech and sentiment in a dataset of approximately 100,000 user posts. The resulting labels serve as outcome variables in a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to evaluate behavioral shifts before and after the policy. The analysis finds that the policy led to a statistically significant decline in hate speech, reducing its probability by approximately 3.2 percentage points in the immediate post-policy period. This effect is particularly pronounced in posts involving regional identity, as revealed through heterogeneous analysis. These results are robust across model specifications and sampling windows. Validation exercises show high consistency between model predictions and human-coded labels. Taken together, the findings suggest that identity-based transparency can reduce online hostility by increasing perceived accountability, contributing to ongoing discussions about platform governance and social norms.",2025,"Chen, Siqi"
macss_242,What’s Embedded in the Texts: Historical and Current Trend of Consumer Judgment and Decision-making,"Consumer research has undergone significant evolution over the past decades while the consumer judgment and decision-making lies at the heart of consumer behavior. This study draws on multiple text analysis methods to analyze themes and topics in consumer decision-making since the 1990s. Leveraging citation analysis, keyword frequency, and topic modeling, the research delves into historical trends using metadata from relevant journal article retrieved from the Web of Science database. The study commences with a historical overview of consumer research before summarizing previous literature on research trends and methodologies. Findings reveal nuanced shifts in research topics over time, indicating enduring influences such as cognitive emphasis in the 1990s, reflective of earlier decades. Furthermore, changes in publication emphasis from practitioner-oriented to academic reflect broader policy shifts. Emerging trends, moral judgment and ethical decision-making, signal evolving research priorities. Notably, the BERTopic model unveils trends that highlights a steady increase of application-oriented topics like financial decision-making and online shop- ping behavior. These findings illuminate the trajectory of consumer research on judgment and decision-making, offering insights into historical patterns and current developments. Scholars are provided with inspiration for future investigations, guiding research agendas and contributing to the ongoing discourse in consumer behavior studies.",2024,"Guo, Xiaowei"
macss_243,When Structure Takes Over: The Autonomy of Global Supply Chain Networks Beyond Firm Capacity and Institutional Constraints,"Building on research that highlights the role of governance, institutional, and network structures in shaping global value chains (Gereffi et al., 2005; Coe & Yeung, 2015; Coleman, 1998), this study investigates why firms in the semiconductor industry continued to outsource production after the 2020–2023 chip shortage, despite significant shifts in risk and cost (Miller, 2022; European Commission, 2022). I analyze how persistent outsourcing patterns are produced not only by firm capabilities or national policies, but also by the autonomous effects of supply chain network structure itself (Coleman, 1988; Granovetter, 1985). Using an original dataset of 160 publicly traded semiconductor firms and 517 buyer-supplier ties, I apply social network analysis, Quadratic Assignment Procedure (QAP), and Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) to systematically disentangle the influence of governance (firm capacity), institutional (state and role similarity), and network (triadic closure) structures on the formation of long-term supplier relationships. While prior research has emphasized the explanatory power of firm resources and state intervention (Williamson, 1981; Goldberg et al., 2024), my results show that institutional similarity—such as shared supply chain role or headquarters country—strongly predicts tie formation within a network, whereas differences in market capitalization and R&D spending do not. Most crucially, the analysis reveals that network structure—specifically, the prevalence of triadic closure—exerts an independent and statistically significant effect on the persistence of outsourcing ties, even after accounting for institutional similarity. This suggests that global supply chain networks can partially decouple from both firm-level capacity and institutional arrangements, sustaining legacy patterns through path-dependent network effects. I argue that, following the chip shortage crisis, the supply chain network itself has become a stabilizing force, locking firms into enduring hybrid relationships and limiting the impact of policy or market interventions.",2025,"Wang, Cosmo"
macss_244,Deriving the Representational Space and Memorability of Object Concepts and Features,"Why are some object concepts (e.g., windshield vs. toothpaste) more memorable than others? Prior studies have suggested that visual and semantic features (e.g., color) and typicality (e.g., for birds: robin vs. penguin) of object images influence the likelihood of being remembered with mixed success (Kramer et al., 2022). One reason for these modest effects may be due to the visual and memory spaces being predominantly modeled using Euclidean geometry, which may not reflect the true structure of the space. In this study, we examined whether an entirely different geometric relationship – such as a continuous hyperbolic space which approximates discrete hierarchies – explains differences in their memorability. Specifically, we hypothesized that image concepts would be geometrically arranged in hierarchical structures and that memorability would be explained by a concept’s depth in these hierarchical trees (where deeper concepts would be less remembered). To test this hypothesis, we constructed a hyperbolic representation space of object concepts (N=1,854) from the THINGS database (Hebart et al., 2019), which consists of naturalistic images of concrete objects, and a space of 49 feature dimensions (e.g., red, tall) derived from data-driven models. Using ALBATROSS (Stier et al., in prep.), a stochastic topological data analysis technique that detects underlying structures of data, we demonstrated that hyperbolic geometry efficiently captures the organization of object concepts and their memorability better than a Euclidean geometry. Specifically, we found that concepts closer to the center of the hyperbolic representational space are more prototypical and more memorable; in contrast, there was no consistent geometric organization of memorability and typicality in the Euclidean space. Taken together, we discover that concept typicality and depth in the hierarchical structure of image concepts contribute to how likely a concept is remembered across people.",2023,"Lee, Meng-Chien"
macss_245,Rent Burden and Economic Mobility: A Generational Cohort Analysis,"This study investigates the relationship between rent burden and intergenerational economic mobility across U.S. counties. Using newly scraped rental data from Zillow (2014–2015) and demographic data from the Opportunity Atlas, the research shifts focus from absolute rent levels to a more precise measure of rent burden—the ratio of median rent to household income. Employing OLS regression, stratified models by birth cohort (1978 and 1992), non- linear modeling, interaction terms, and quantile regression, the study reveals that higher rent burdens are significantly associated with lower economic mobility, particularly among middle-income households. Stratified analyses indicate that the younger 1992 cohort faces a stronger negative impact from rent burden compared to the 1978 cohort, although gen- erational interaction effects are not statistically significant. The results also highlight that poverty rates and racial composition continue to exert significant constraints on mobility outcomes. Policy recommendations emphasize the expansion of affordable housing, regu- lation of institutional investors in the rental market, and integration of housing support with workforce development programs. By addressing the understudied impact of rent bur- den and enhancing methodological precision, this research contributes new insights into structural barriers limiting economic mobility across generations.",2025,"Wang, Anyue"
macss_246, How does LLM Shape and Mediate Online Communication? An Exploration of Toxicity Identification and Detoxification with ChatGPT,"This study explores the socio-technical challenges of moderating online toxic discourse with large language models, specifically ChatGPT. Situated at the intersection of social science and computational linguistics, this study critically assesses ChatGPT’s capacity to identify and mitigate toxic contents. It interrogates the efficacy of ChatGPT in navigating the nuanced terrain of online communication, where linguistic toxicity patterns are both overt and subtle. By answering the two main research questions: 1. How effective is ChatGPT in identifying toxic content in online comments, and how does its performance compare to other models, such as the OpenAI moderation model? 2. To what extent can ChatGPT detoxify toxic comments, and what is the trade-off between toxicity reduction and preservation of the original content’s meaning? The research underscores the complexity of automating content moderation, revealing instances where ChatGPT’s algorithmic judgments fail to align with human perceptions of toxicity. This misalignment raises questions about the social implications of relying on AI for discourse regulation. Moreover, the study advocates for a hybrid model of moderation that integrates machine precision with nuanced human understanding, emphasizing the importance of ethical considerations in AI deployment. By examining the limitations and potential of ChatGPT, this thesis contributes to the broader discourse on the role of technology in shaping online communities and the ethical dimensions of AI-mediated communication.",2024,"Zhao, Wenyi"
macss_247,Framing Fertility: A Topic Modeling Analysis of Chinese Media Discourse on the Three-Child Policy (2021–2025),"China’s Three-Child Policy, announced in 2021, represents the most recent effort by the Chinese government to address the country’s prolonged low fertility rate and aging demographic structure. While existing literature has examined the policy from a demographic and policy design perspective, relatively little attention has been paid to how news media, as a critical intermediary between policymakers and the public, frame and respond to the Three-Child Policy. Using a corpus of 3,339 Chinese news articles published between May 2021 and April 2025, this study applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques—specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling—to identify domi- nant themes and perspectives in media coverage. Results show that economic concerns, such as labor force shortages and financial burdens associated with childrearing, are central to media discourse. The media also increasingly acknowledge public needs around childcare, housing, and healthcare; however, deeper issues such as persistent gender inequality in caregiving expectations remain under-addressed. This paper argues that without a more gender-equitable reframing in both policy design and public discourse, the Three-Child Policy’s long-term effectiveness may be undermined. The study contributes to the growing field of fertility policy research by offering an empirical analysis of media narratives and their social implications.",2025,"Liu, Hanyun"
macss_248,Heterogeneous Effects of Price Fluctuation and Crime on the Structure of the Short-term Rental Industry,"This study investigates the heterogeneous effects of price fluctuations and crime happening nearby on listing performance in the short-term rental industry. Using a comprehensive dataset of Airbnb listings in Chicago from 2014 to 2024, the study examined how price surges and drops influence occupancy rates, Average Daily Rate (ADR), and revenue across different Airbnb property segments. Employing a combination of spatial analysis, tempo- ral analysis, causal forest, and machine learning methodologies, the study identified four distinct property clusters with varying sensitivity to property characteristics and review rat- ings. The findings reveal a strong association between price surges and increased occupancy rates. While this counterintuitive result may reflect a signaling mechanism, we caution that causality cannot be conclusively established. It is also possible that elevated demand may precede price changes. Hosts raise prices in response to unobserved shifts in demand — suggesting that these outcomes reflect correlated dynamics rather than strictly causal relationships. Price increases may operate as signals of quality or scarcity that elevate perceived value. Conversely, price drops generally result in revenue losses, highlighting asymmetric market responses to price adjustments. Additionally, the research find that neighborhood safety characteristics moderate these effects, with crime incidents having heterogeneous impacts across property segments. This research contributes to revenue management theory by demonstrating that strategic price positioning can leverage quality signaling effects, where consumers interpret higher prices as indicators of superior value in certain market segments. The findings provide practical insights for hosts and platform operators seeking to optimize pricing strategies in increasingly complex short-term rental markets.",2025,"Zhang, Shuyi"
macss_249,Chinese Import Competition and Media Slant in U.S. Local Newspapers,"Does the recent surge in Chinese imports affect the media slant against China in the United States? Using a dataset of 157 U.S. local newspapers from 1998 to 2017, I construct a new measure of media bias through machine-learning-based sentiment analysis. Implementing the shift-share empirical strategy on the newspaper level, this paper finds that newspapers whose circulation states face greater exposure to Chinese import competitions report more negative news about China. The source of negative description more stems from non-trade-related topics and editorials. Though the findings in Lu et al. (2018) remain unchanged, this paper argues an overestimation tendency in the previous literature by matching keywords and tries to provide less unbiased point estimates.",2021,"Wu, Linghui"
macss_250,Examining Semantic Shifts of Sociological Papers from 1940 to 2020 Using Text Embeddings,"Concerns have been raised regarding the potential fragmentation and weakening historical continuity within sociology during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. This study investigates the evolution of sociological discourse by using text embedding models. By turning paper documents into high-dimensional embeddings, this research analyzes eight decades of papers (1940-2020) from the American Sociological Review (ASR) and the American Journal of Sociology (AJS). Findings indicate that while semantic meanings of sociology gradually and steadily shift away from its past, the studies in the twenty-first century have only tenuous semantic relationships with those in the 1940s and 1950s. Moreover, the development of sociology appears to follow the shape of multiple ongoing subprocesses rather than a series of clearly defined distinct periods. This research contributes to understanding the semantic shift of publications in social sciences.",2025,"Ye, Tianle"
macss_251,"Implicit Guarantees, Liquidity, and Market Discipline: An Empirical Analysis of China’s Municipal Bond Market","Using almost 160 000 secondary-market trades for all thirty-one mainland provinces between 2015 and 2024, this paper asks whether China’s provincial-bond yields reflect local credit fundamentals or remain anchored by expectations of central support.  Panel regressions of the municipal–treasury spread on bond-level traits and province-year fiscal variables, with province and year fixed effects, yield three integrated findings.  First, the structure of intergovernmental transfers is decisive: a larger budgeted (formula-based) transfer-to-GDP ratio and a higher share of discretionary “free” transfers both narrow spreads, whereas unanticipated execution shortfalls widen them, showing that investors reward predictable and flexible support and penalize uncertainty.  Second, fiscal discipline is priced.  Higher deficits relative to GDP or expenditure raise borrowing costs, an effect that peaks at maturities below three years where liquidity risk is most salient.  Third, the term structure of spreads is steep at the front end and almost flat beyond ten years.  Coupon, deficit and transfer variables account for the yields on bonds with short and medium maturities. In contrast, spreads on bonds with long maturities hardly respond to any observable factor. This muted reaction stems partly from the challenge of gauging default risk far in the future and partly from institutional arrangements such as zero risk weighting for banks, eligibility as collateral at the People’s Bank of China and classification as high quality liquid assets. Together these rules narrow the differences in borrowing costs across provinces at long horizons. Fixed-effect estimates reveal persistent geographic heterogeneity: prosperous coastal provinces such as Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang pay the lowest premia once fundamentals and market depth are considered, whereas older industrial or resource-dependent regions face elevated spreads unless cushioned by large, regular transfers.  Overall, China’s provincial-bond market operates in a hybrid regime: investors now discriminate on observable fiscal capacity and transfer credibility, yet implicit guarantees and regulatory privilege still mute risk pricing at the long end.  Strengthening real-time fiscal disclosure, codifying and enforcing transparent transfer rules, and phasing out preferential capital treatment would sharpen market signals and advance the transition toward fully risk-based provincial borrowing.",2025,"Liao, Jiaying"
macss_252,AI-Driven Judgments: Visualizing Occupational Stereotypes from Facial Features,"Physical appearance, particularly facial attractiveness, plays a significant but context- sensitive role in workplace evaluations. While the “what is beautiful is good” stereotype suggests a universal beauty premium effect in organizational settings, recent research has shown that additional facial traits, such as trustworthiness, competence, gender, and age, also shape judgments, and their effects vary by occupational context. This study inves- tigates how both appearance- and competence-based visual traits influence perceived job suitability across client-facing and back-office roles in two industries: finance and retail. A total of 376 participants rated 817 hyper-realistic synthetic faces, generated using Style- GAN2, on their suitability for four roles: Financial Advisor, Risk Analyst, Retail Sales Associate, and Inventory Manager. Predictive models trained on these ratings were used to estimate trait scores of perceived job suitability and facial traits for novel faces and ana- lyze their associations. The client-facing Retail Sales Associate role was strongly associated with attractiveness-based traits, while both back-office roles and the client-facing Financial Advisor prioritized competence-based traits, with appearance-based traits showing weaker or negative correlations. These findings suggest that the influence of facial traits on per- ceived job suitability depends more on the industry context than on whether a role involves client-facing interactions. The findings challenge the notion of a uniform beauty premium and emphasizes the need for bias-conscious hiring practices and theoretical frameworks that account for contextual variability in impression formation.",2025,"Ma, Zimo"
macss_253,The Price Sensitivity of the Demand for New Electric Vehicles in Washington State,"This study examines price sensitivity and consumer preferences for electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington State in 2024 by building a discrete-choice demand model to capture consumers’ EV purchasing decisions. The findings show that price elasticity is smaller in magnitude when using transaction prices (mean of -0.87) compared to the estimate based on Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Prices (MSRPs), which yield a mean elasticity of -1.22. This suggests that MSRPs mostly lower than actual transaction prices may overestimate price elasticity. Transaction price is therefore preferred for demand-side subsidy design and for studying consumer preferences. Additionally, the results highlight the importance of using trim-level data, as aggregating to the model level introduces significant estimation bias. A counterfactual analysis further demonstrates that removing federal tax credits would substantially reduce EV sales, while shifting Washington State tax credits from being based on transaction prices to MSRPs would only shift sales across EV trims. These findings emphasize the need of EV tax credits to promote EV adoption and their impacts on consumers’ vehicle choices.",2025,"Fu, Joyce"
macss_254,Influence of Executive Lineage Ties on Short-Term Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Returns: Evidence from China,"This study investigates whether kinship-driven social ties, proxied by shared surnames among top executives, influence short-term performance in merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions in China. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese listed-firm M&A events from 2000 to 2023, we employ an event-study methodology with cumulative abnormal re- turns (CAR) over multiple windows ([-1, +1], [-2, +2], and [-3, +3]) to gauge market reactions. Our OLS panel regression models with fixed effects reveal that the presence of executives with the same surname in the acquiring and target firms is associated with sig- nificantly higher announcement-period CARs. This effect is especially pronounced for rarer surnames, suggesting that a smaller clan-group identity fosters stronger in-group trust and cooperation, consistent with social identity and in-group favoritism theories. We further find that surname overlaps between acquirer and target increase the likelihood of deal suc- cess, indicating that kinship-like ties can facilitate negotiation and agreement. Notably, the positive impact of shared executive surnames on CARs is more pronounced in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than in non-SOEs, implying that in more formal or resource-constrained institutional environments, informal relationship capital plays a crucial role. By introducing surname similarity as a novel measure of inter-firm social connection, this research offers new theoretical insight into how deeply embedded cultural bonds (family names and clan heritage) can shape corporate outcomes. The findings contribute to the growing culture and finance literature by opening a fresh perspective on guanxi-like trust in M&A, and they carry practical implications for M&A strategy and corporate governance in China.",2025,"Yi, Zhuojun"
macss_255,Pioneering Efforts towards AI-Assisted Reflective Political Discourse,"In an era where online platforms increasingly mediate public discourse, enhancing the quality of democratic deliberation through technology is crucial. While much effort in online deliberation platforms has been focused on public and group deliberation, the “internal reflection” stage has received less attention, despite it being a prerequisite for informed public engagement. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers new possibilities for creating accessible and inclusive platforms for this purpose. This thesis presents the design and preliminary implementation of an AI agent intended to facilitate internal reflection on political topics by employing a Socratic Method-inspired approach for generating follow-up questions. Through the agent development process, the project identifies key challenges, including the absence of a gold standard for constructive follow-up questions and noticeable discrepancies in value judgments between AI and humans. To address these issues, we conducted an annotation experiment with both human and LLM annotators, assessing the effectiveness of various questioning strategies across different sources and lengths. The findings reveal preferences and discrepancies in question selection both between and within human and AI annotators, underscoring the challenges in designing AI interactions that effectively mimic human reflective dialogue. Humans prefer human-generated data over AI-generated ones, emphasizing the need for human involvement in AI to better capture the nuanced qualities of human interaction in complex discourse settings. This research highlights the potential of reflective AI to enhance democratic participation and points to future directions for improving AI-driven interactions for deliberation.",2024,"Ji, Yuxin"
macss_256, Recurrent Collaboration Foster Non-Local Transition of Research Interest: Evidence from the Computer Science Domain,"This thesis investigates the development of research interests in the field of computer sci- ence by examining how researchers transition between research objects and how different collaborative relationships impact these transitions. The study begins with an exploration of the dual spheres of research activities: the idea sphere and the engineering sphere, along with the two primary epistemic faculties—intuition and agency—that enable researchers to navigate between them. Drawing on qualitative data from interviews and case studies, the thesis highlights how these faculties contribute to the generation and evolution of research interests. A case study of a computer scientist’s publication trajectory illustrates the dif- ference between local and non-local research interest transitions, showing how researcher’s shifts in research objects, accompanied by the reconstruction of epistemic faculties, mark significant changes in research interest. The quantitative analysis further investigate the relationship between collaborative rela- tionships and local and non-local interest transition. The study uses bibliometric data from the DBLP-D3 dataset and employs measures such as the Distance of Object Engagement (DOE) and the Distance of Community Affiliation (DCA). The findings reveal that while one-time collaborations contribute to incremental changes in research interest, recurrent col- laborations play a pivotal role in facilitating non-local transitions that require substantial knowledge and skill adjustments. This suggests that stable, intensive collaborators provide essential support, allowing researchers to adapt their intuition and agency when exploring new, unfamiliar research domains.",2024,"Lyu, Zejian"
macss_257,Behavioral Correlates of Theta Bursts in medial Prefrontal Cortex,"Theta coherence between the medial Prefrontal Cortex and the hippocampus have been found to be correlated with behavioral performance when the rats are completing spatial tasks. While theta happens in apparent bursts, previous studies haven’t directly quantified the properties of those bursts and their behavioral relevance. In the present study, theta bursts are first identified over 6 rats when performing a spatial navigation task and quantified in terms of duration, height, number of cycles, and area under the curve. The spatial alignment of those bursts reveals that they happen more frequently at the well. Further comparison between the timing of theta bursts and rats’ movement suggests a relationship between theta bursts and rats’ direction change.",2024,"Yang, Anmin"
macss_258,Designing LLM-Agents with Personalities: A Psychometric Approach,"This research introduces a novel methodology for assigning quantifiable, controllable and psychometrically validated personalities to Large Language Models-Based Agents (Agents) using the Big Five personality framework. It seeks to overcome the constraints of human subject studies, proposing Agents as an accessible tool for social science inquiry. Through a series of four studies, this research demonstrates the feasibility of assigning psychometrically valid personality traits to Agents, enabling them to replicate complex human-like behaviors. The first study establishes an understanding of personality constructs and personality tests within the semantic space of an LLM. Two subsequent studies---using empirical and simulated data---illustrate the process of creating Agents and validate the results by showing strong correspondence between human and Agent answers to personality tests. The final study further corroborates this correspondence by using Agents to replicate known human correlations between personality traits and decision-making behaviors in scenarios involving risk-taking and ethical dilemmas, thereby validating the effectiveness of the psychometric approach to design Agents and its applicability to social and behavioral research.",2025,"Huang, Muhua"
macss_259,The Role of Recommender Systems in Amplifying Empathic Bias and Perceived Consensus,"Recommender systems can personalize user experiences but also risk reinforcing ”echo chambers,” where like-minded views are amplified, potentially leading to increased cognitive and affective polarization. This study investigates the impact of these algorithms on empathy and cognition, within the context of legal abortion. Participants’ (n = 129) attitudes toward legal abortion and their dispositional empathy were assessed. They then viewed abortion-related tweets, with (n = 71) or without (n = 58) being curated by a simulated recommender algorithm. Subsequent assessments measured their situational empathy (prosocial resource allocation, perspective-taking, and empathic concern) to simulated profiles who had clear stances on legal abortion and were in distress including death of daughter, job loss, and major injury. Findings reveal that the recommender algorithm amplified biases in cognitive empathy aspects, but it did not affect affective empathy components such as empathic concern. The algorithm also increased perceived consensus. These results underscore the need for advanced recommender systems to incorporate depolarization measures to help mitigate the negative impacts on social cohesion.",2024,"Jin, Yingzi"
macss_260,Linking Scientific Research: Extracting Sentences Containing Dataset Information,"Despite the popularity of data-driven research in scientific fields, we are intrigued by the combined value of datasets in a given area. Our research seeks to establish strategies for retrieving words containing dataset information from academic publications using a specific example of COVID-19 epidemiological papers, which was encouraged by previous studies concerning research originality and how combinatorial work improves science. We deployed LDA and word embedding algorithms to filter epidemiological papers versus clinical ones. We also annotated sentences based on whether each sentence in the abstract and title parts mentions dataset information. Pre-trained word representations enabled classification models to discriminate between data and non-data sentences. The unexpected finding is that, while more diverse terms in a publication's abstract and title help advertise it in terms of citation, they make this document less likely to be one of the top-cited papers. In conclusion, while we have not reached accurate conclusions for identifying data sentences in papers, we have uncovered techniques for filtering possible data sentences. We suggest inspecting a larger corpus in the next stage to evaluate the impact of alternative datasets and gather more information for the paper's word representations and citation.",2021,"Xu, Yilun"

In response, news sources have created an area of reporting called the misinformation beat. Covering conspiratorial content, however, poses unique epistemic challenges for journalists and researchers. One concern is that covering emerging conspiracy theories may inadvertently expose trusting readers to an especially seductive form of misinformation. Another concern is that savvy conspiracy theorists may be manipulating the media into unintentionally “spreading the word”. Given these dilemmas, this project seeks to quantify and qualify the coverage of conspiracy theories by digital news sources in the United States.

macss_262,Emotional Catalysts and Dynamic Networks: A  Computational Analysis of Mobilization in  Digital Activism,"The murder of George Floyd served as a focusing event, an unexpected and tragic incident that captured public attention and reoriented ongoing discourse. In communication theory, such events often catalyze rapid agenda shifts and heightened collective expression, particularly within the digital public. This study investigates both structural and content-level transformations in information diffusion on Twitter before and after the event. Results indicate that: (1) user engagement intensified post-event; tweets exhibited increased expressions of anger and sadness, and users who entered the conversation afterward were more responsive to emotionally charged narratives; (2) the underlying social network became more centralized, shifting from decentralized user-to-user interactions to an influencer-driven broadcast model; and (3) despite this centralization, weak unidirectional ties across community boundaries played a critical role in bridging structural holes, enabling the wide dissemination of grievance-oriented, high-intensity emotional content, often framed diagnostically. Building on these findings, the study identifies a dual-pathway model of affective diffusion: weak ties maximize emotional reach by spreading high-arousal messages across communities, while strong ties consolidate motivational framing. Together, these findings suggest that focusing events amplify user engagement and fundamentally reshape the structural and affective dynamics of online information diffusion, embedding emotional expression within the network's topology.",2025,"CHEN, Huanrui"
macss_263,Assessing Burnout Dynamics Through Weibo: The Spatial-temporal Heterogeneity of Environmental and Economic Factors in Shanghai Pre and Post-Lockdown,"This study explores the influence of  integrating macro-built environment data, micro-level subjective and objective street environment perceptions, socioeconomic demographics of residents' burnout emotions and their spatial-temporal heterogeneity, with a particular focus on the changing patterns across three phases of Shanghai's pandemic lockdown. The research  establishes a pipeline based on large language models to extract burnout emotions from social media content, and constructs a multi-dimensional spatial-temporal analytical framework integrating OLS, geographically weighted regression, and nonlinear interpretable machine learning modeling techniques. By collecting social media data, the study first validates the effectiveness of large language models in identifying burnout emotions from social media (with a consistency coefficient of 0.61 with human ratings), providing a scalable method for real-time psychological monitoring during crises. Analysis using spatial analysis reveals significant spatial clustering patterns of burnout emotions among Shanghai residents. Geographically weighted regression identifies five typical spatial patterns of influencing factors. Walkability consistently protected against burnout citywide, while green spaces lost restorative function in commercial centers. High-density housing areas with complex visual environments amplified psychological distress, and central districts formed ""youth burnout peaks"" where young, educated populations concentrated. Longitudinal results reveals significant nonlinear relationships and critical threshold effects between influencing factors and residents' burnout emotions, with these relationship patterns exhibiting various forms of transformation across the three phases. For example, population density's impact on burnout shifted from a negative correlation and ""Reverse Excitement"" pattern before lockdown to a ""Basic Need"" pattern during lockdown. Similarly, the young population ratio evolved from a single-threshold model with positive correlation (""Semi-Performance"") to negative correlation during and after lockdown (""Performance"" to ""Excitement"") with complex multi-threshold interval models.  Green space transformed from weak positive correlation as an ""Excitement Factor"" before lockdown to strong positive correlation as a ""Performance Factor"" during lockdown, indicating that visually accessible but functionally inaccessible green spaces became sources of stress. Visual complexity reversed from positive correlation (""Basic Need"") before lockdown to negative correlation (""Excitement Factor"") highlighting how environmental monotony enhanced the value of perceptual stimulation. These findings challenge static urban health standards, suggesting environmental influences operate through dynamic systems that transform during crises, providing frameworks for resilient urban planning integrating spatial structure with psychological wellbeing.",2025,"Cai, Yuxuan"
macss_264,Impact of Employment Concentration in High-tech Industries on Income Inequality,"In this study, we investigated the relationship between income inequality and high-tech employment in developed and developing nations using time-series and cross-sectional data from various sources. Our empirical analysis revealed a negative relationship between high-tech employment share and income inequality, with varying impacts across manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. Additionally, utilizing a hierarchical clustering algorithm, we categorized sample countries into two groups based on five parameters representing different levels of economic development. Our empirical findings reveal that the impact of high-tech industry concentration on income inequality is not significant in emerging economies. However, in advanced economies, the observed pattern remains consistent with that found in the overall sample.",2023,"Lei, Feihong"
macss_265,A More Robust Monetary Policy Shock: A Natural Language Processing Approach of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Reports,"This study develops a more robust strategy for identifying monetary policy shocks in Thailand by incorporating both quantitative forecasts and qualitative sentiment extracted from central bank communications, specifically Monetary Policy Report. Building on Romer and Romer, 2004 framework, I apply Ridge regression to estimate the policy rate using a rich information set, combining macroeconomic forecasts with sentiment indices derived through topic modeling and dictionary-based analysis of Monetary Policy Reports from 2013 to 2023. The residuals from this model are interpreted as exogenous monetary policy shocks. Impulse response functions (IRFs), estimated via a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, show that a contractionary shock leads to a decline in inflation and appreciation of the real effective exchange rate, consistent with theoretical expectations. However, real GDP growth initially rises and unemployment briefly falls, suggesting short-run deviations possibly due to anticipatory effects or delayed transmission. These dynamics gradually align with standard macroeconomic theory over time. Compared to shocks identified using ordinary least squares (OLS), Ridge-based shocks generate more stable and plausible responses across macroeconomic variables. Exogeneity tests confirm that the shock series is not predicted by lagged macroeconomic indicators. These findings highlight the value of integrating natural language processing and machine learning to enhance monetary policy analysis in emerging market economies.",2025,"Tepkham, Phornchanok"
macss_266,Refugee Inflow and Native Female Labor Supply,"This project investigates the impacts of refugee inflows on native female workers’ labor supply characterized by employment status, usual hours worked, and occupational mobility. Utilizing data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) records of refugee inflow, the project aims to use a fixed-effect panel data regression with instrumental variables to identify the causal effect of refugee inflows on US less-skilled native females. The results show no significant impact on overall employment, annual hours worked, or occupational mobility. Heterogeneity analysis draws attention to the most vulnerable group. Refugee inflow has a significant and negative effect on female workers without a high school degree, leading to lower working hours, a lower probability of being employed, and a higher probability of being temporarily laid off. The analysis also unveils the effect of refugee inflows on pushing the female working-age population to work in household production, which leads to decreased labor supply on the extensive margin.",2024,"Liu, Sifei"
macss_267,"Swipe Left, or Right?  Decoding Generative AI's Believable Social Behavior and Decision-Making in a Simulated Dating App","Dating apps shape romantic opportunities but remain inaccessible to researchers due to commercial secrecy and privacy concerns. We developed an alternative approach using authentic user profiles and Large Language Model agents,powered by GPT-4o to simulate dating decisions in a controlled environment. These agents engaged in 80,000+ simulated interactions, generating both choices and explanations for their preferences. Our supervised machine learning analysis (regression models, decision trees) and unsupervised semantic clustering revealed consistent patterns: education emerged as the dominant predictor of dating desirability across demographic groups. Gender differences were particularly pronounced in evaluation hierarchies—female agents prioritized income in male profiles, while male agents emphasized age when assessing females. Control experiments demonstrated high behavioral fidelity, with agents consistently acting according to their assigned demographic attributes and producing reasoning patterns that closely mirror documented human mate selection criteria. This methodology offers a transparent believable method for studying bias patterns in social decision making typically hidden behind proprietary algorithms.",2025,"Li, Aidi"
macss_268,A Tale of Two Monetary Transmissions: Evidence from State-Owned Enterprises in China,"Monetary authorities use contractionary monetary policy to rein in inflation pressure and expansionary monetary policy to stimulate economic growth. However, economists had noticed that the responses to these two types of policy shocks might not be equal. In this paper, we first use local projection methods proposed by Jorda to compute the impulse responses of monetary policy shocks in China under different regimes of output growth and inflation rates. The results show that the responses are asymmetric. We further explored a possible mechanism for such phenomenon that China has a characteristic institutional arrangement that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) with favorable access to financing exist. Using sector-specific macroeconomic time series and state-dependent local projections, we provide evidence that SOEs and private-owned enterprises (POEs) in China respond heterogeneously to different types of monetary policy shocks. Based on a firm-level dataset, we also provide micro evidence that SOEs benefit more from a monetary easing and suffer less from a monetary tightening compared to POEs in terms of leverage ratio, and thus, confirms the asymmetric transmission.",2023,"Fang, Chongyu"

macss_270,Beyond the Numbers: An Analysis of the Subjectivity and Gender Biases of Course Feedback Comments from Students,"Analyzing textual comments beyond numerical ratings in course feedback reports is essential for instructors, administrators, and future students to gain a comprehensive understanding of the course, such as teaching effectiveness, potential evaluation subjectivity, biases, etc. This thesis presents a comprehensive analysis of approximately 2,500 course feedback re- ports containing 113,278 comments from CMSC and SOSC departments at the University of Chicago, from the 2020 Spring quarter to the 2023 Winter quarter. We apply text summarization, natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and machine learning techniques to organize individual comments, explore key topics, identify potential subjectivity and gender bias in the comments. Preliminary analysis reveals common concerns related to the course structure, content, effectiveness, and clarity in the educational process. The contributions are twofold: (1) the extensive dataset of course feedback comments and instructor profiles we collected, tagged with credible sentiment and subjectivity labels, constitutes a valuable resource for scholars in education evaluations; (2) we develop a text summarization and subjectivity identification pipeline, which enables the extraction of representative nouns and adjectives as well as the calculation of the degree of subjectivity expressed in the comments. These insights can be used to inform education policies and practices, thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making and fair evaluation mechanisms.",2023,"Wei, Mintao"
