macss_01,News to Numbers: A Comparative Analysis of Traditional and API-driven LLMs in Stock Return Prediction,"This thesis investigates the comparative effectiveness of two large language model (LLM) deployment paradigms—zero-shot inference via commercial APIs and supervised fine-tuning of transformer-based models—for stock return prediction using financial news. Leveraging a novel dataset of over 30,000 Dow Jones Newswire (DJN) articles aligned with firm-level returns from 1989 to 2020, the study systematically evaluates OpenAI’s GPT-4 in a zero-shot setting against fine-tuned BERT-based models trained on identical text–return pairs. The analysis employs a rolling-window cross-validation framework to ensure robustness across market regimes and emphasizes not only predictive accuracy but also operational feasibility, cost efficiency, and scalability. Results demonstrate that both modeling approaches produce statistically significant predictive power above random baselines, yet with distinct trade-offs. GPT-4 achieves 53.38% directional accuracy and a Sharpe ratio of 1.076, highlighting its ability to extract meaningful signals without domain-specific tuning. Its operational simplicity, low setup cost, and per-call flexibility make it particularly attractive for rapid deployment and lightweight financial applications. By contrast, the supervised BERT model delivers markedly stronger financial performance, attaining an annualized Sharpe ratio of 4.08 and mean daily returns of 12.81 basis points. These superior outcomes underscore the value of domain-specific adaptation, but they come at the cost of substantial GPU resources, specialized expertise, and ongoing maintenance requirements. Temporal analysis further reveals that both approaches maintain predictive robustness across diverse economic conditions—including the dot-com era, the 2008 financial crisis, and post-crisis market environments—though performance metrics vary with shifts in efficiency and volatility. Importantly, GPT-4 provides consistent positive alphas despite its modest accuracy, while fine-tuned BERT models extract higher-magnitude signals during volatile periods, reinforcing the economic relevance of tailored architectures. The findings contribute to the growing literature at the intersection of financial economics and natural language processing by offering the first unified empirical framework to compare API-driven and locally fine-tuned LLMs for financial prediction. They highlight a fundamental trade-off in institutional strategy: API-based models democratize access to advanced language capabilities with minimal infrastructure, while fine-tuned models yield superior risk-adjusted returns for institutions capable of sustaining the computational investment. This research advances both theory and practice by demonstrating that textual data continues to contain exploitable information for asset pricing and that the operational context—budget, infrastructure, and regulatory considerations—should guide the choice of modeling paradigm. Ultimately, the results suggest that financial institutions must navigate between accessibility and performance, as the integration of LLMs into quantitative trading evolves from experimental adoption toward strategic deployment.",2025
macss_02,Labor Market Shocks and Heterogeneous Adjustment: A Semi-Nonparametric Approach,"This study examines how labor markets adjust to international trade shocks in recent decades, with a particular focus on the China trade shock that has fundamentally reshaped global manufacturing since the 1990s. To estimate the effect, the project will combine structural economic modeling with semi-parametric machine learning techniques to understand heterogeneous labor market responses across demographic groups and industries. By merging rigorous economic theory with flexible estimation methods, we aim to provide nuanced insights into the transition costs workers face when responding to trade disruption, addressing a gap in the current literature that often treats adjustment frictions as homogeneous across populations. After the estimation, we'll apply agent-based modelling framework on simulated counterfactual sample to experiment with different tariff intervention and agent features to further understand the dynamics and welfare implication.",2025
macss_03,The Cost of Decentralization? Welfare Comparisons between Double Auctions and Automated Market Makers in Transactive Energy Markets,"This paper quantifies the welfare implications of adopting an Automated Market Maker (AMM) in place of the simultaneous time-delimited double auction used in the Transactive Energy Service System (TESS). We develop an agent-based simulation of a peer-to-peer electricity market populated by heterogeneous demand, solar, utility, and battery agents, and evaluate market outcomes under varying technical and operational parameters. Battery strategies are modeled both through value function iteration (VFI) dynamic programming and an alternative informed trader heuristic that exploits anticipated intertemporal price differentials. Regression analysis on simulation output reveals that, across a broad range of scenarios, the AMM delivers statistically significant gains in total social welfare relative to the double auction. While the VFI battery strategy often generates negative surplus under the AMM, these losses are offset by gains to other agents. The informed trader battery eliminates the negative battery surplus without diminishing total welfare, indicating that strategic adaptation can improve equity of surplus distribution while maintaining efficiency. These results suggest that the cost of decentralization—defined as welfare loss from substituting an AMM for a double auction—can be negative in certain contexts, implying a potential net benefit. However, we find that part of the AMM’s advantage stems from its implicit capacity flexibility, which may not be feasible in practical deployment. We conclude by outlining future research to assess AMM performance under realistic capacity constraints and more diverse trading behaviors.",2025
macss_04,The Art of Positivity in Drawing: Unveiling the Impact of Positive Mood States on Visual Creativity via Deep Learning,"This study integrates visual creative tasks with artificial intelligence techniques to study the flexibility pathway proposed by the dual pathway to creativity model. According to this model, positive activating moods enhance originality—the uncommonness of ideas, solutions, or products— by increasing cognitive flexibility, which facilitates the switching between thoughts and supports the exploration and connection of diverse ideas. Diverging from the predominance of verbal tasks, this study employs the Incomplete Shape Drawing task to track both the dynamics of the creative process indicative of cognitive flexibility and the originality of the final completed drawings. Using validated film clips for mood induction, I randomly assigned 90 participants to one of three groups: High-Arousal Positive Mood, Low-Arousal Positive Mood, and Neutral Control. Participants then completed three rounds of the Incomplete Shape Drawing Task (with qualitatively distinct stimuli), each followed by a section to provide a written narrative on their thought process. Flexibility was assessed through two modalities: (1) stroke-level drawing behavior using the Compositional Stroke Embedding model to compute entropy and Bhattacharyya distance; and (2) semantic-level flexibility using Divergent Semantic Integration to quantify the integration of conceptually distant ideas in participants’ narratives. Originality was evaluated using AuDrA, a deep learning model trained on human originality ratings from the same task. The results indicated that while mood induction effectively altered participants’ self-reported arousal and valence, no significant differences in flexibility or originality were observed across mood conditions. However, correlational and multilevel regression analyses suggested two distinct modes of flexibility: persistent exploratory breadth and adaptive switching. Crucially, only adaptive switching flexibility measures significantly predicted originality. Together, these results raised caveats on transient mood manipulations in creativity research, while illuminating the value of process-level, adaptive flexibility as a core mechanism underlying originality. Moreover, it demonstrates the utility of integrating drawing-based tasks with artificial intelligence to capture the dynamic, cross-modal mechanisms underpinning original thoughts.",2025
macss_05,Mapping Informality and Violence: Machine Learning Insights into Crime Patterns Across South African Police Jurisdictions,"This study examines the relationship between neighborhood informality and crime rates in South Africa, where rapid urbanization has led to criminal organizations stepping in to provide services within some of these settlements. Applying K-means clustering and Local Moran’s I analysis to 1,164 police jurisdictions, we observe that the cluster with the highest level of informality also exhibited the lowest crime rates. Furthermore, in clusters representing moderately dense urban areas, linear regression reveals a statistically significant negative correlation between levels of informality and crime rates. Machine learning models, including KNN and random forest, show that crime can be predicted with low MSE, with k-complexity emerging as a key feature. Finally, a longitudinal case study on crime and growth data offers further insight into potential causal relationships, though the results are not statistically significant. These findings have implications for urban governance and public safety policies in developing countries.",2025
macss_06,Locked In or Lifted Up? Impact of Kenya land settlement plan on long-term economics development,"This paper examines the long-term effects of Kenya’s post-independence land settlement policy, focusing on the ""Million Acre Scheme,"" a large-scale redistribution initiative implemented in the 1960s. Using a geographic regression discontinuity (RD) design and multiple waves of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, the study evaluates how formal land rights granted through the settlement program have shaped economic development outcomes over time. The analysis links a newly digitized historical map of settlement boundaries to geocoded household data and reveals that individuals living within settlement areas exhibit significantly higher wealth levels but lower educational attainment—particularly among women and those located far from markets. These results suggest that while land tenure security may have spurred investment and asset accumulation, it also constrained household mobility and reduced incentives to invest in human capital. The findings underscore the importance of balancing tenure formalization with broader access to economic and educational opportunities when designing land reform policy.",2025
macss_07,Financing Under a Mandatory Single-payer Universal Health Insurance System,"This paper develops a stylized two-part tariff model to evaluate the fiscal and distributional effects of introducing income-based coinsurance in Egypt’s new Universal Health Insur- ance System (UHIS). Using 2019/20 Household Income, Expenditure and Consumption Survey (HIECS) data, I derive closed-form expressions for household reservation prices for healthcare under mandatory premium payments and calibrate the model with empirically estimated demand elasticity. Numerical simulations compare the status-quo design, flat 7 percent premiums and 10 percent coinsurance with broad medical exemptions, to alter- native schedules that segment coinsurance by income quintile and decile while imposing financial protection caps. Relative to the simulated baseline deficit of EGP 332 billion, the best-performing decile schedule shrinks the funding gap to EGP 52 billion: an 84 percent improvement. The results demonstrate that coinsurance can operate as a redistributive instrument, not merely a cost-containment device, and offer a tractable framework for other low- and middle-income countries that seek to balance equity and solvency under universal health insurance mandates.",2025
macss_08,Intergenerational Educational Spillovers in Pakistan,"Education provides a channel for poverty escape via intergenerational mobility (Zuo et. al, 2023). Pakistan’s stifled mobility and consistent political instability provides an opportunity to learn more about the impact of structural and policy changes on intergenerational mo- bility. This study examines the spillover effects of 1972 nationalization policy on children’s educational outcomes in Pakistan with a particular focus on intergenerational spillovers mediated through fathers’ education. A comprehensive microdataset is used from Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurements (PSLM) 2019-20 survey. To analyze the impact of policy regional level Difference-in-Difference (DiD) approach was adopted. To quantify the causal impact further a complementary Instrumental Variable approach was also uti- lized. Findings suggests that 1972 nationalization policy improved educational access in restricted sample case, especially in rural areas with meagre 0.33 additional schooling on average. Whereas, IV approach reveal that Fathers’ education showed strong intergener- ational spillovers, as an additional year of schooling increased a child’s education by 1.03 years. However, DiD results suggested that overall educational attainment decline was ob- served post policy. Additionally, impact on child’ earning outcomes also confirms that just the supply side reforms are not sufficient for interegenerational mobility unless high quality of schooling is also ensured.",2025
macss_09,Concept Over Craft: The Acceleration of Creative Peaks in Early 20th Century Modernism,"This study identifies a historical shift in classical music from experimentalism to conceptualism, particularly between Late Romanticism/Impressionism and Early 20th Century Modernism. Using professional performance frequency since 1996 as a retrospective measure of innovation, we estimate composer-level age-performance profiles for 35 canonical figures. Regression results reveal significant lifecycle differences: pre-1874 composers peaked later, consistent with sustained technical refinement, whereas post-1874 Modernists peaked notably earlier, often in their twenties, reflecting conceptual innovation. These findings persist through various robustness checks, controlling for instrumentation, duration, composer identity, and calendar year effects. The results support Galenson’s theory of artistic archetypes and highlight how shifting aesthetic values profoundly influenced both the timing and historical recognition of musical creativity.",2025
macss_10,What stop people from taking an ‘almost free’ COVID-19 vaccine?,"This essay explores why the COVID-19 vaccine take-up rate is relatively lower in the adult group, despite its benefits and effectiveness. Leveraging a Berry-Levinsohn-Pakes (BLP) demand framework, I estimate how local pandemic severity and demographic factors shape individual’s vaccination behavior across states. The analysis reveals that disadvantaged groups—those with lower education, poorer health, and unemployment—are more likely to postpone their vaccination plans, while younger individuals are more responsive to changes in perceived risk. These findings call for careful policy design that accounts for spatial and age-specific heterogeneity in vaccination hesitancy.",2025
macss_11,Analysis of Moral Language in Self-Improvement Discourse through Natural Language Processing,"Self-improvement consists of making efforts to improve various traits such as health, appear- ance, efficiency, etc. Previous research has identified that popular culture is increasingly portraying aspects of self-improvement as obligations, as if they were moral requirements. This moralization can create stigmatization or be prejudicial when it fosters self-obsession and perfectionism (Coeckelbergh, 2022; Kraaijeveld & Jamrozik, 2022). Recent social me- dia studies have identified these issues among small samples of users, so the present work aims to contribute to the literature by expanding the scope and assessing if the findings of smaller studies hold true in a broader social media context and considering more self- improvement areas (Bell et al., 2024; Camacho-Mi˜nano & Gray, 2021; Coeckelbergh, 2022). Due to the speed of information flow and norms diffusion on the internet, social media platforms are relevant spots to observe the transmission of self-improvement ideas (Puryear et al., 2025). The guiding research questions for the analyses are: (1) Is moral language present in discussions about self-improvement? (2) Are there specific topics within self- improvement discussions that tend to be framed with a higher moral tone? and (3) How is the use of moral language associated with emotions in the context of self-improvement? To answer these questions, data from the subreddit r/selfimprovement was analyzed us- ing the LIWC software, the Moral Foundations Dictionary, and MoralBERT. Furthermore, LDA topic modeling was utilized for uncovering topics and comparing moralization among them. Findings suggest that the r/selfimprovement subreddit contains higher moral lan- guage, particularly among social-related topics and health & fitness discussions. Moreover, content with higher moral language was found to show higher negative emotion and anger language, supporting previous work on the risks of moralization. However, results also suggest that engagement with moral ideas within self-improvement may not be as negative when approached from a reflective and thoughtful perspective.",2025
macss_12,A Review of Relationships of Cannabis Legalization With Alcohol Use and Consumption,"The legalization of marijuana, especially recreational cannabis legalization(RCL) has become prevalent in the States. The causation effect of RCL on alcohol use or consumption has aroused public attention widely, and the relevance of the two substances is essential to all aspects of society including economic development, public health issues, and taxation. Therefore, the review summarizes the recent studies’ results and conclusions to reveal the causation effect of recreational marijuana legalization on alcohol use.Online literature Research was performed for articles published in the last five years of English in main datasets. After abstract reviewing and full-text reviewing, 12 studies are included to compare the results in research on the effect.",2025
macss_13,Challenging Dual-Coding Theory: Picture Superiority Effect Persists in Aphantasia,"Dual-coding theory proposes that superior memory for pictures compared to words (the ‘picture superiority effect’) and concrete words compared to abstract words (the ‘concrete- ness effect’) both stem from the ability to store information as verbal and image codes in memory. According to the theory, having two distinct memory codes increases recall prob- ability, as either code can independently lead to successful retrieval, and one code can serve to cue the other. The current study tests this theoretical explanation by examining recall performance in individuals with aphantasia—the inability to voluntarily generate mental imagery. Based on dual-coding theory, aphantasic individuals should show neither picture superiority nor concreteness effects due to these individuals’ inability to generate mental images and retrieve image-based memory codes. We recruited 62 aphantasic individuals and 69 typical imagers who completed a memory task with free recall of studied stimuli. Data were analyzed using mixed ANOVA and planned comparison t-tests. We compared recall performance between aphantasic and typical imagers across four stimulus types: pictures, symbols, concrete words, and abstract words. Despite their mental imagery deficit, aphan- tasic individuals demonstrated a robust picture superiority effect. Moreover, while typical populations show similar recall for pictures and symbols, aphantasic individuals displayed superior recall for symbols compared to pictures, perhaps because symbols’ simpler visual properties enable more efficient encoding through alternative strategies like motor imagery. In addition, both aphantasics and controls showed better performance with abstract relative to concrete words—contrary to typical concreteness effects—possibly because our abstract words had corresponding everyday symbols that made them more readily processed despite imagery limitations. These recall patterns across different stimuli in aphantasics challenge dual-coding theory’s explanation that superior recall for visual stimuli stems primarily from the formation and retrieval of supplementary image codes, indicating that either dual-coding is incorrect and some other non-dual-coding mechanism is responsible, or that, at the very least, dual-coding theory requires substantial modification to account for our present find- ings. This study provides novel insights into the relation between mental imagery and memory, challenging traditional theoretical frameworks and suggesting the need for alter- native explanations of these well-established memory phenomena.",2025
macss_14,Predicting Clinical Trial Completion and Success using Machine Learning and NLP,"This study introduces a dual-task machine learning framework for predicting both the opera- tional completion and scientific success of clinical trials using data from ClinicalTrials.gov. Leverag- ing structured trial metadata and unstructured textual descriptions, we develop predictive models that assess whether trials are likely to complete and whether they meet their primary endpoints. For the first task, ensemble models like XGBoost significantly outperform traditional baselines, partic- ularly when enriched with contextual embeddings derived from BioLinkBERT. For the second task, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-driven annotation pipeline using GPT-4o-mini to label trial success based on publication content. Human evaluation confirms its high accuracy. Across both tasks, our framework demonstrates the value of combining structured features, natural language processing, and scalable LLM-based labeling to improve the understanding and forecast- ing of clinical trial performance. This approach not only enhances predictive accuracy but also contributes to better utilization of large-scale biomedical data.",2025
macss_15,Between ‘Hukou’ and ‘I Do’: How the 2014 Hukou Reform Reshapes China’s Marriage Market,"n this paper, I study how the 2014 relaxation of China’s household registration (Hukou) restrictions reshaped the marriage market for internal migrants. The reform significantly eased the requirements for obtaining local Hukou in non-megacities, while megacities re- tained strict controls. Exploiting this institutional change, I use a difference-in-differences framework to compare marriage outcomes between treatment cities (cities with population below 5 million) and control cities (cities with population above 5 million). I find that, after the reform, migrants in treatment cities became less likely to marry local Hukou holders, and the educational gap between spouses narrowed. These results suggest that the value of Hukou status as a marriage-matching advantage declined when local registration became easier to obtain. As a result, individuals placed more emphasis on non-institutional traits, such as education, when selecting partners.",2025
macss_16,Seasonal Influences on Regional Consumer Satisfaction: A Computational Analysis of Yelp Reviews,"This study investigates how consumer satisfaction in the restaurant sector varies across seasonal periods and geographic contexts, using over one million Yelp reviews from Philadelphia and Tampa—two cities with distinct climatic and economic profiles. By integrating structured data (star ratings) with unstructured data (text-based sentiment scores), the analysis applies sentiment analysis, Ordinary Least Squares regression, ordered logistic models, and Random Forests to detect spatiotemporal patterns in consumer evaluations. Results show that satisfaction is generally higher in warmer seasons, but the strength of seasonal effects differs across cities, with Tampa exhibiting greater seasonal variation than Philadelphia. Sentiment scores are more sensitive to seasonal shifts than star ratings, and systematic divergence between the two emerges across cities and seasons. These findings suggest that economic structures, such as tourism reliance, may shape satisfaction more than climate alone, and highlight how textual analysis captures emotional nuance often masked by numeric ratings. The study also demonstrates how combining structured and unstructured data can reveal nonlinear and context-dependent satisfaction dynamics that conventional models may overlook. This contributes to consumer research by offering an integrated framework for modeling seasonal and geographic variation in satisfaction and by validating the utility of sentiment analysis in large-scale behavioral studies. Practical implications for service management and design are discussed, and future research directions are proposed to extend this work across diverse service contexts and environmental conditions.",2025
macss_17,Investigating the Pathways from World Trade Center Exposures to COVID-19 Severity and Long-Term Sequelae,"Our study examined the associations between WTC exposures and COVID outcomes using two analyses: one focused on COVID severity and the other on post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), which is known as long COVID. In the severity analysis, our aggregate exposure measure revealed that a significant portion of the effect on COVID severity is mediated by obstructive airway disease (OAD), indicating that impaired respiratory health is a key pathway linking WTC exposures to more severe acute illness. In the PASC analysis, we found that the overall effect of WTC exposures on long COVID is largely mediated by impaired respiratory health. These findings suggest that while OAD is a critical mediator for both COVID severity and PASC, additional mechanisms likely contribute to long-term outcomes.",2025
macss_18,Emotional and Cultural Patterns Expressed in Chinese and Japanese Cuisines in U.S. Consumer Reviews,"Ethnic restaurants in the United States hold significant cultural and social meanings, being widely embraced by diverse communities. As these restaurants adapt to American dietary habits, they not only reflect but also influence culinary trends. Chinese cuisine has long been a popular choice among American diners, while Japanese cuisine has increasingly captured the attention of consumers. This growing interest can be traced back to the 1980s and 1990s, when chefs began incorporating Japanese ingredients and culinary techniques into their menus, a phenomenon known as the “Japanese turn.” By the twenty-first century's second decade, concepts like umami and shun had become familiar to many American chefs (yamashita, 2020). This thesis investigates how U.S. consumer reviews on Google reflect differing perceptions of Chinese and Japanese cuisines, focusing on emotional tone, word choice, and cultural framing. Using a dataset of over 690,000 reviews, the study applies TF-IDF, log-odds ratio, and Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis to identify distinct linguistic and emotional patterns associated with each cuisine. The findings reveal that consumer language around Chinese cuisine tends to reflect habitual, everyday experiences, suggesting symbolic assimilation, whereas Japanese cuisine is more frequently framed through cultural markers and positive emotional descriptors—indicating a retained sense of ethnic distinctiveness. This study contributes to broader discussions of authenticity, emotional evaluation, and cultural stratification in consumer discourse, showing how digital reviews both mirror and construct cultural narratives around ethnic food in the U.S.",2025
macss_19,"Understanding Bullet Chat Moderation on Bilibili: Patterns, Effects, and Implications","On the popular Chinese video-sharing platform Bilibili, users can post live comments that float across video streams or broadcasts—a unique interaction known as ''bullet chat''. This real-time commenting system is actively moderated by an automated scoring mechanism known as the ''censor score'', which assigns each comment a value from 1 to 10, reflecting its likelihood of being censored based on content appropriateness. This study investigates how moderation on Bilibili varies according to user identity, emotional sentiment of comments, and topic sensitivity. By analyzing publicly available moderation data and employing large-scale sentiment classification methods, we discovered distinct moderation patterns. We found that severity of penalties differ substantially depending on the type of violation and the imposer of the penalty (System detect versus Human detect). Moreover, accounts with different certifications—such as government entities versus individual influencers—exhibit significantly different censor scoring trends even within the same discussion topics. Institutional accounts, generally received higher censor scores, suggesting variations in moderation standards tied to user identity and content context.",2025
macss_20,Papaya Privacy: Empowering Web Users through AI-enabled Cookie Consent and Data Monetization Tools,"The current online advertising data ecosystem is broken. Web-users are repeatedly deceived by dark design patterns into clicking “Accept All” on cookie consent banners, unwittingly opting in to a myriad of unintended data flows. These data flows can have drastic consequences, ranging from targeted advertisement all the way to social oppression. To combat these problems, we present Papaya Privacy, a new way to empower web-users using AI-powered cookie consent and data monetization mechanisms. We designed and implemented two interventions, Agent Papaya and Papaya Payback. With Agent Papaya, our Agentic AI-powered chrome extension, we give users the ability to set their cookie preferences once and execute this seamlessly across websites, mitigating the effects of dark design patterns. With users now able to effectively opt-out of data collection, we conceptualize an alternative data market, Papaya Payback, based on the theories of Data Unions and Contextual Integrity. Through simulation, we show that by allowing users fine-grained control of who gets to access what data of theirs and for what purposes, the Papaya Payback market creates greater social welfare than the current online advertising data market. Together, Papaya Privacy’s two interventions demonstrate a practical path toward a consent-enforcing, user-centered, and economically viable data economy for online advertising.",2025
macss_21,From Pixels to Preferences: Mixed Logit Demand Estimation Using Product Image Embeddings for E-Commerce,"Accurately estimating substitution patterns in e-commerce is difficult because most demand models rely on hand-coded product attributes that are often missing or incomplete. I propose a multimodal-embedding approach that replaces those attributes with low-dimensional features extracted from product images and texts by pre-trained deep-learning models. Embedding principal components are entered—alongside price—into a mixed logit, allowing visual and textual similarity to discipline cross-price elasticities. Applied to 3,478 Amazon purchases in a 25-item Headsets category, adding just two image principal components from a ResNet-50 encoder lowers the Akaike Information Criterion by 296 points relative to a price-only logit and reduces the out-of-sample mean absolute error of market-share forecasts by 22%. Diversion ratios become more concentrated, raising the category-level Herfindahl–Hirschman Index from 0.073 to 0.088 (+21%), which reveals tighter competition within visually defined sub-segments such as mid-range gaming headsets. These results demonstrate that information already present in product pages can materially improve demand estimation, even when no structured attributes are available.",2025
macss_22,"Do Cryptocurrency Valuations Reflect Their Technological Innovation? Insights from Marketing, Security, and Code Levels","This thesis investigates how technological innovation influences the valuation of cryptocurrencies, focusing on the top 50 DeFi tokens by market capitalization. To capture the multifaceted nature of blockchain innovation, I construct three distinct indicators: a Whitepaper Innovation Index based on word embedding and clustering techniques, a standardized Audit Security Score derived from rubric-guided evaluation of audit reports, and a Code Maturity Proxy based on GitHub fork counts. These metrics are combined with financial data from CoinMarketCap and project-level metadata including blockchain architecture classification, academic involvement, historical volatility, and token age. Cross-sectional regression analysis shows that the proposed innovation indicators—while theoretically meaningful—do not exhibit statistically significant relationships with either market capitalization or trading volume. Instead, token age emerges as the most robust and consistent predictor across specifications, indicating that investor behavior is more responsive to project longevity than to technical complexity. Historical volatility is also negatively associated with market capitalization, suggesting that market participants tend to penalize assets with unstable pricing histories. The results suggest that, within the current market landscape, signals of maturity and stability outweigh detailed technical disclosures in shaping investor perception. This study contributes to the empirical literature by introducing a structured, multi-dimensional framework for evaluating technological innovation in crypto assets and by shedding light on the behavioral cues that dominate pricing dynamics in decentralized finance.",2025
macss_23,The Effect of Monetary Policy Shocks on Stock Returns and Firm Characteristics in the US,"This thesis studies the effect of monetary policy shocks on stock price change before and after FOMC meetings. Results show that contractionary monetary policy surprise cause negative asset returns on average, vice versus. I also found that reactions of individual stocks to monetary shocks are not fully explained by Fama French five-factor model. Then, results show that size, profitability, book leverage, current ratio, and current liabilities ratio are related to stock prices change induced by monetary policy surprise.",2025
macss_24,Displacement of Online Communities by Artificial Intelligence: The Impact of ChatGPT on Stack Exchange,"This study explores the impact of ChatGPT on Stack Exchange's sustainability and community health by analyzing data from 40 communities from September 2021 to September 2023. In the community-level analysis, we used the difference-in-differences method, utilizing the previous year's data to construct the control group. We found the launch of ChatGPT significantly decreased the number of new posts on the platform, with the rollout of GPT-4 intensifying this effect. Additionally, our findings indicate notable heterogeneity in the impacts of GPT across various communities. Technology communities experienced the most significant negative effects. In the user-level analysis, we found the reduction in post numbers primarily resulted from decreased activity among users registered in the last two years. Subsequently, we used the Temporal Causal Inference (Turjeman and Feinberg, 2023) method using data from users who registered 1-6 months earlier to construct control groups and conducted regressions using the Difference-in-Differences and Generalized Synthetic Control Method. We identified the effect of GPT by comparing the number of posts from users with different registration times during the same registered duration. We found the negative GPT effect consistent with previous results, and it is more pronounced among users with higher community status and more social interaction.",2024
macss_25,Familiarity Breeds Complexity: The Impact of Brand Loyalty on E-Commerce Advertising and Promotion Decisions,"This study investigates the impact of consumers' brand loyalty on sellers' promotional and advertising strategies on China's leading e-commerce platform, Taobao. Utilizing a unique dataset in 2013, the research examines how sellers adjust their behaviors in response to the proportion of familiar consumers, a direct measure of loyalty. The study extends Agrawal's (1996) game-theoretical framework, testing the hypothesis that seller with smaller proportion of loyal consumers increase promotional frequency and advertising spending as the loyalty size increase. The research innovatively addresses the challenge of reverse causality by using the platform algorithm as an instrumental variable. Empirical findings support the hypotheses, providing new insights into the relationship between brand loyalty and seller behavior in e-commerce. The paper contributes to the literature on firm responses to consumer loyalty, offering practical implications for marketing strategies in digital marketplaces.",2024
macss_26,Unlocking Drivers behind Stock Price Movements: Apply Structural Deep Learning to Predict Operating Profitability from Text Data,"In empirical asset pricing, traditional numerical firm characteristics often fall short in fully encapsulating firms’ performances, as highlighted by Ralph (2023). To address this limi- tation, researchers have increasingly turned to alternative data sources, such as news, 10K filings, conference calls, to augment predictive models for stock price movements (Gabaix et al., 2023; Glodd & Hristova, 2023). In this project, we leverage structural deep learning techniques to combine LLama2 embeddings of conference call transcripts with traditional numerical features to generate operating profitability as a novel stock price predictor. We hypothesize that the new variable, predicted operating profitability, informed by rich textual data, can capture additional insights into firms’ true potential (Feldman et al., 2020; Kim & Nikolaev, 2023). By delving into the neural network’s predictive capabilities from tex- tual data, this study contributes to empirical asset pricing literature as well as the ongoing exploration of applying neural networks to discover drivers behind stock price fluctuations.",2024
macss_27,Linking Rent Regulation to Housing Quality in New York City 2017-2021,"This thesis examines the spatial distribution of rent-regulated housing and housing mainte- nance code violations and explores the spatial spillover effects of rent regulation on property upkeep. It also analyzes changes in housing conditions before and after the implementation of the Rent Law of 2019, which made it more difficult for property owners to deregulate properties. Utilizing spatial clustering and regression analyses of data from New York City, the study reveals: (1) a spatial overlap and clustering of rent-regulated housing and housing maintenance code violations; (2) a negative impact of rent regulation on housing quality that extends beyond individual census tracts to neighboring areas; and (3) potential exac- erbation of housing maintenance issues following the enactment of stricter rent regulation laws. These findings suggest challenges of rent regulation policies to balance affordability with quality and that these policies might disproportionately affect low-income households who are vulnerable to displacement and rely on rent regulations for housing stability in gentrifying neighborhoods.",2024
macss_28,Large-scale Linguistic Mimicry: Evaluating Persuasion Efficiency of Large Language Models,"Interacting with millions of global users, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Chat- GPT may possess unprecedented capabilities for automated, personalized persuasion at scale. Are LLMs actually good at personalized persuasion? Do they become more persua- sive when they personalized the texts to match users’ linguistic patterns? This research undertakes to evaluate the personalized persuasion potentials of LLMs when they learn to speak like users. We assess GPT-4’s mimicry capability against mimicry naturally occur- ring in human interaction and evaluate linguistically personalized persuasion’s effectiveness through a survey experiment. Results show GPT-4’s proficiency in linguistic mimicry akin to humans, yet linguistically personalized arguments aren’t more effective than general ones. Our approach underscores the importance of domain expertise in eliciting model capabilities and constructing evaluations for governing frontier AI systems. Future research should advance domain-inspired evaluation methods to better inform policy decisions for AI labs and governments regarding model training and deployment.",2024
macss_29,A Multidimensional Analysis of Language Model Sentiment and Self-Reported Emotional States,"This thesis presents a multidimensional analysis of the relationship between sentiment as evaluated by a large language model (RoBERTa) and self-reported emotional states during mind-wandering episodes. The study utilized data from the Audiovisual Attention (AVA) study, which captured the spontaneous speech of participants. The RoBERTa model was employed to quantify the emotional valence of this speech, categorizing it into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. In parallel, self-reported measures were taken, allowing for a comparison between computational sentiment analysis and participant self-assessment. Findings demonstrate that while both approaches provide valuable insights, they offer complementary information regarding the emotional valence of thoughts. The research highlights the prevalence of neutral sentiments in mind-wandering and the model’s accuracy in classifying emotional tones, suggesting the potential of natural language processing tools in psychological research.",2024
macss_30,Gender Identity and Representation in the Context of Economic Development in India,"Does legislators' gender identity affect representation, indicated by their participation in legislative activity? I ask whether their gender impacts the extent to which elected representatives present and relay issues to seek government action on. Are females inherently different as legislators in the democracy? This project uses a natural language processing approach along with a dynamic difference-in-differences strategy to investigate. Using a zero-shot classification technique, I create five outcome ``scores'' to evaluate the Indian Parliament's textual Question Hour data on: development, corruption, accountability \& transparency, programmatic representation, and clientilistic representation. The analysis reveals that female representation has minimal to no discernible normalized average total effect per treatment unit on development scores. Slight negative effects are observed in the cases of programmatic and clientelistic representation scores. However, a modest negative effect on accountability and transparency scores contradicts expectations, suggesting nuanced interactions that may not universally improve governance quality through increased female representation. In addition, the only positive effect, though small, on corruption scores reveals the priorities of female representation over time periods. These findings underscore the complexity of gender effects across different governance dimensions and temporal contexts, highlighting the importance of individual temporal effects and their association with specific electoral cycles in informing the dynamism in representation in developing contexts.",2024
macss_31,Unveiling Attrition: Using Predictive Modeling to Investigate Key Drivers of Voluntary Employee Turnover at a Mid-Size Global Food and Beverage Organization,"Voluntary employee turnover, or attrition, can be a significant impediment to the effective functioning of an organization. With each employee replacement, time and money are spent to search for and train a new hire, so companies strive to identify areas that lead to turnover and effectively plan for its occurrence. Academics in organizational psychology and management studies have produced extensive literature on this issue, often taking the approach of identifying variables that range from employee-specific to industry-wide. However, results are not consistent at the company level, as each organization is placed in a unique context. As a result, companies benefit the most from conducting analysis using their historical data. The present study implemented this approach by determining the most significant drivers of employee turnover at a mid-size food and beverage organization (“the Company”). Given 6 years of data on employee attributes and turnover, this study used various interpretable machine learning models to point to key correlates of voluntary turnover in addition to generating predicted probabilities based on the current workforce. This analysis drove the main deliverable, presented to the Company in the form of a slide deck, which visualizes the relationships between significant variables and voluntary turnover. Additionally, turnover forecasts for 2024 were generated. The models used in this study showed strong predictive ability, with consistent variables emerging as significant across various model types. This analysis highlights areas of interest that are predictive of voluntary turnover while identifying further opportunities for inquiry.",2024
macss_32,Shifts in Yelp Sentiments and Ratings After a Restaurant's Michelin Star Announcement,"In the digital age, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) plays a pivotal role in shaping consumer decisions, particularly in the high-end dining sector where Michelin stars serve as a hallmark of culinary excellence. This study investigates the impact of Michelin star awards on consumer feedback on Yelp, focusing on changes in sentiment and ratings across multiple dimensions of the dining experience—food, service, price, and ambiance. Utilizing a quantitative approach, the research analyzes Yelp review data from restaurants in the United States awarded Michelin stars, employing sentiment analysis and statistical methods to assess the post-award shifts in consumer feedback. The findings reveal that Michelin stars do not uniformly affect all restaurants; while higher-tier establishments generally experience stable or improved ratings, one-star restaurants often see a decline post-award. This study suggests that Michelin stars significantly enhance sentiments towards service quality and perceived value for money, particularly in higher-starred restaurants. Conversely, sentiments related to ambiance and food, although positive, show minimal changes directly attributable to the Michelin recognition. This study contributes to the understanding of the Michelin effect within the digital landscape of consumer feedback, highlighting the complex interplay between prestigious accolades and eWOM. The research underscores the importance of managing customer expectations in the aftermath of receiving a Michelin star, particularly concerning pricing and value perception. For future research, this study suggests the need for longitudinal analyses to capture long-term effects and recommends incorporating qualitative methods to delve deeper into consumer motivations and perceptions. The findings hold significant implications for restaurateurs, who must navigate the heightened expectations associated with Michelin recognition, and for academics, pointing to the evolving dynamics of consumer behavior in the realm of luxury dining.",2024
macss_33,Grandparents and the Gender Gap: How does grandparent-provided childcare affect parents’ employment in China?,"This paper explores the impact of grandparental childcare on labor market gender inequalities in China, particularly focusing on how grandmothers' involvement influences maternal employment outcomes. Employing a three-agent simultaneous choice model within a three-generational family framework, this study integrates theoretical analysis with empirical evidence from the China Family Panel Studies. The empirical analysis utilizes a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to examine the effects of a grandparent's death on parental employment decisions. My findings reveal that the loss of grandparental childcare, especially following the death of a grandmother, significantly reduces mothers' labor participation and income. This research underscores the critical role of grandparents in the labor market dynamics and highlights the necessity for policy interventions to support working families, addressing broader issues of gender inequality in China.",2024
macss_34,An evaluation of the effectiveness of 2020 ontario temporary covid-19 pandemic pay,"I empirically study the effect of the 2020 Ontario temporary pandemic pay program on health workers’ labor market outcomes. By using a difference-in-differences approach, I found a positive causal effect on health workers’ labor market outcomes. I also find heterogeneous effects of the program by gender, with a larger effect on women’s likelihood of being employed than men, which could potentially balance the gender gap in labor force participation.",2024
macss_35,Living in the Hub: A Platform Study of Desire Semantics,"Since the late 2000s, the world has experienced an unprecedented platformization of cultural production. Cultural content is created, disseminated, and consumed on online platforms, leading to a state wherein algorithmic systems and coding infrastructure primarily mediate interaction with audiovisual media. The question this thesis addresses is how we can use existing algorithmic and software systems within platforms to study sexual desire and sexuality or, at the very least, the lust of their users. To do so, I assess the social norms unfolding within the content categorization and recommendation systems of Pornhub, a popular pornographic video online platform. My methodological approach is multi-modal since observational data (collected and found) are combined with interpretation and digital experiments. Conventional content analysis methods, such as term frequencies or semantic networks, are limited in their ability to capture the nuances of video category semantics. To work around this, I use a custom word embedding model treating categories as the model’s “vocabulary” and mapping them to a 100-dimensional semantic space in which similar words appear in proximity. Results showcase a promising and detailed semantic understanding of category meaning that can be further applied in studies of algorithmic bias of the platform’s video recommendations.",2024
macss_36,"Intergenerational Changes in Education and Social Mobility in Contemporary China: Based on Gender, Area and Family Size","This study explores the significant changes of the gender gap, regional divide, and family size effect in the context of intergenerational education improvement and social mobility after the launch of China's reform and open-up policy. The reform and open-up policy, initiated in 1978 China, introduced significant social changes including increased urbanization, changes in family structure, shifts in social norms and values. This study will contribute valuable insights into how such large-scale national policy shape and affect social structures and patterns of mobility among different groups of population, and either reinforce or mitigate forms of social inequality. Therefore, intergenerational education improvement and social mobility are the main focuses as well as key indicators in this study to measure the prevalence, magnitude and changes of the gender gap, regional disparities, and family size effect. This study utilizes data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a nationally representative, longitudinal household survey of over 14,000 families in contemporary China, and mainly multi-linear regression models with interactive effects to investigate the impact of the reform and opening policy. The results of this study indicates that while there are still social inequality and differences among different population groups in modern China, these differences to some extent have been effectively and significantly reduced over time with the influence of the reform and opening policy.",2023
macss_37,Correcting Misperceptions on Indian Whatsapp with Experimental Adaptation: Building an Experimentation Platform on Whatsapp,"This paper explores the challenges associated with India’s digital transformation, with a specific focus on the surge of misinformation via WhatsApp in rural regions. As the world’s second-largest internet user base, India faces unique issues with misinformation, especially due to user-led fact-checking on encrypted platforms and influential religious rhetoric. To address these concerns, a WhatsApp-based surveying tool was developed to directly access rural users’ perspectives and collect a corpus of circulating media. This study aims to understand varying user interactions and sharing tendencies with thematic messages and identify effective misinformation deterrents. The research’s pivotal contribution lies in the newly developed experimen- tation platform, enabling effective data gathering and testing of popular interventions against misinformation using adaptive experimentation.",2023
macss_38,TOWARD A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO EX-ANTE FTA IMPACT ESTIMATION ANALYSIS,"A standard approach to the analysis of free trade agreements (FTAs) involves simulating a general equilibrium model of the global economy in response to shocks that reflect trade cost liberalisation. A few methods are common to estimate the scale of these essential trade shocks, but little formal research has gone into evaluating the success of these different approaches. Developing a systematic approach to the evaluation of FTA trade shock estimates is essential to informed policy making in international trade, as well as to the academic literature on the evaluation of FTAs. This paper contributes to the existing small literature focused on estimating trade impacts for use in economic modelling of trade. It extends a framework first used in a paper by [Baier et al., 2019]. This method presented a novel way to evaluate ex-ante trade shock estimation methodologies by posing the issue as a prediction problem to predict ex-post FTA shocks identified through a first stage gravity model. In this paper I extend the original paper’s ex-ante analysis by making use of a wider dataset, as well as adopting recent methodological innovations from the machine learning literature. I find that amongst the most important considerations in making ex-ante FTA impact estimates are whether a model is trained on data excluding outliers and the type of machine learning model chosen. Furthermore, the broader set of data used is found to be important in improving success.",2023
macss_39,Open Particles in Social Medium: Open Collaboration in GitHub,"This thesis proposes an innovative approach for the comprehensive and structured modeling of online open collaboration. By conceptualizing individuals, teams, and collaborative environments as social atoms, molecules, and mediums respectively, it employs concepts and tools from physics and chemistry to illustrate human interactions. This research introduces an analogical framework that retains the fundamental principles of select traditional natural science instruments while also integrating more probabilistic and dynamic elements to address the disparities between the physical and social systems. It applies and adapts two tools and one concept from physics and chemistry - namely the collaborative periodic table (inspired by the periodic table of elements), the probabilistic collaboration equation (based on the reaction equation), and the social superposition state (derived from quantum physics). These tools and concepts are employed to study open collaboration on GitHub, leveraging a dataset sourced from the GitHub open-source community that includes collaborative data from hundreds of thousands of users. The findings of this study not only provide deeper insights into the behavior patterns of open collaboration participants but also illuminate a bottom-up strategy for future sociophysical pursuits.",2023
macss_40,The Popularity of extremism: A computational exploration of extremist political speech on Twitter,"We define political extremism as a duality of internal ideology and external performance and explore whether its performative component on digital platforms is associated with greater popularity. We select three measures of extremism performance supported by prior literature and examine their ability to predict human-labeled extremism in crowd-sourced data. Then we observe how the social media posts’ popularity is dependent on these measures. We find that, out of the three measures, sentiment has a statistically significant association with popularity, but could not yield evidence to confirm it to be a good predictor of extremism.",2023
